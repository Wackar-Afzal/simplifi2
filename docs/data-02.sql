<p>Spending across virtually all markets and use cases is increasingly migrating to digital means with cards accounting
for the lion’s share of such payments. According to a recent study by McKinsey, card-based payments are expected to
drive ~53% of the payments in the GCC by 2026. Broadly, cards can be classified into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepaid Cards:</strong> The lightest and simplest form of cards. Funds need to be loaded on the cards in advance,
and cards can then be used anywhere the card network is accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Debit cards:</strong> These would most likely be linked to an existing bank account with an adjoining overdraft facility.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> These are used as credit instruments, and a credit check is required before these can be issued.
These debt instruments generally have an interest component and other late payment fees attached to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The card ecosystem consists of a <code>four-party model</code>. It''s the industry''s accepted framework for processing card payments
between buyers and sellers. These four parties are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cardholder:</strong> The buyer who generally owns the funds and uses the card</li>
<li><strong>Issuing bank:</strong> The bank which is the issuer of the card to the cardholder</li>
<li><strong>Acquiring bank:</strong> The bank which owns the relationship with the merchant (the seller)</li>
<li><strong>Merchants:</strong> The party who is selling the item to the buyer</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/">SimpliFi</a> is an enabler that empowers any business to issue its own branded cards. The business can
custom build its card product with its own set of features which can be used to offer differentiated propositions to
its customers or to solve payment-related pain points in its ecosystem (e.g. suppliers payments, payouts to its
employees or partners, etc). For a business to issue its own branded, customized cards, there are multiple aspects
that need to be taken care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issuer Bank:</strong> Issuer banks would be responsible for providing custody accounts, settling payments with the card
schemes and fulfilling regulatory compliance requirements</li>
<li><strong>Processors:</strong> These are technology platforms that provide tools for businesses to issue and manage their card programs</li>
<li><strong>Schemes:</strong> These are card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Mada, etc.) that provide a BIN (essentially a
numbering series) on which the cards are issued. The scheme’s logo appears on the card which identifies the network
that it belongs to</li>
<li><strong>Card manufacturers:</strong> These are certified players who would be able to print physical cards based on the design
provided by businesses and approved by issuing banks and schemes</li>
<li><strong>Card tokenization:</strong> There are wallet providers (e.g. ApplePay, GooglePay etc) which enable virtual cards to be
provisioned through the phone so that transactions can be made on POS terminals in a contactless manner to pay by
card as well as online payments.</li>
<li><strong>Data enrichment:</strong> Relatively newer to the cards business, these companies help enrich transaction data by
cleaning up and enhancing data coming through the works and adding additional valuable information i.e., merchant
logo, merchant location, spend categorization etc.</li>
<li><strong>KYC service providers:</strong> Depending upon the nature of the card program, KYC (verifying cardholder identity) may
be needed during card issuance or delivery of the cards which is enabled by such providers.</li>
<li><strong>Courier companies:</strong> Ensure delivery of cards to the relevant card holders and, in some cases perform verification
at the time of delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> We all would have called our banks for some aspects related to our cards. When businesses
issue their own branded cards, they need to also ensure that they provide the necessary customer care channels
for cardholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, card issuance has multiple technology, compliance, and operations components, and a lot of effort goes into
bringing these components together and ensuring these run seamlessly. Therefore, setting up and running a card program
requires substantial time and capital investment which is where modern card issuance platforms like
<a href="/">SimpliFi</a> can help realize massive savings in time and money for businesses looking to launch their
bespoke card programs.</p>
<p>While launching a card program comes with obvious benefits of driving new revenue streams, streamlining business
operations, getting deep insights into cardholder spend behavior, and building loyalty with the target segment (e.g.,
customers, partners, merchants etc.) it is pertinent to understand the economics associated with running bespoke
card programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology costs:</strong> Building and running a technology stack (e.g., operations portal, app, etc.), hosting an
addressing local regulations and certifications like PCI DSS.</li>
<li><strong>Processor costs:</strong> Processing costs associated with issuing and maintaining cards, transaction processing,
and tokenization.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance costs:</strong> KYB/KYC costs to onboard businesses and cardholders and for ongoing screening to fulfill
compliance requirements and manage risks.</li>
<li><strong>Interchange and scheme fee:</strong> Transaction costs and revenue share taken by issuing banks and schemes for
each transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of capital:</strong> Where funds are required to be loaded on the cards in advance (e.g. prepaid cards) there
are implicit costs around funds being locked onto the cards. Technologies like Just-in-time funding which are
made available on the SimpliFi platform, have solved this problem by ensuring that cards are loaded in real-time
during the time of transactions, thereby ensuring that funds are not blocked on the cards.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud Monitoring:</strong> Margins on payment products are thin, which means that fraud can very quickly eat into those
margins if not kept in check, thereby necessitating cutting-edge fraud management tools.</li>
<li><strong>Card production &amp; delivery:</strong> If physical cards are required the cost of production and delivery of cards can add
up quickly, especially if a certain percentage of cardholders are not active or generating sufficient
transaction activity.</li>
<li><strong>Customer care:</strong> Providing customer care, especially 24×7 bi-lingual costs can be expensive especially in
the initial stages when the card program is scaling up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance refers to the adherence to a set of regulations and industry standards designed to protect consumers and
ensure the security of financial transactions in addition to protecting organizations from all types of risks. This
includes compliance with laws such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Data Protection and
Privacy Regulations, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations.</p>
<p>Adhering to regulations and best practices for preventing fraud, suspicious transactions and safeguarding sensitive
information is crucial for financial institutions to maintain a good reputation, avoid heavy fines and ensure they
don’t become a target by criminals. It is important for companies to stay up-to-date with the latest compliance
requirements, and to have robust processes in place to ensure they are meeting them.</p>
<p>Global compliance is the process of a business following all laws, standards, and regulations that apply to them
across the globe. Managing compliance for different jurisdictions can be a challenging task for businesses and
organizations operating in multiple countries. This is particularly true for industries that are heavily regulated,
such as financial services and information technology. In order to maintain compliance, organizations must be aware
of and adhere to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which they operate.</p>
<h4>The challenge of compliance</h4>
<p>Information security is one area in which compliance can be particularly challenging. Different jurisdictions have
different laws and regulations regarding data protection and privacy, and organizations must ensure that they are in
compliance with all of them. This can include implementing security measures such as encryption and regular security
audits, as well as ensuring that employees are trained on proper data handling practices.</p>
<p>Another area of compliance that can be challenging is money laundering and terrorist financing. Organizations must
implement procedures to detect and prevent these activities, as well as comply with reporting requirements. This can
include undertaking regular risk assessments, conducting proper due diligence on corporate clients as well as
individuals, and training employees on how to identify and report suspicious activity.</p>
<p>To manage compliance for different jurisdictions, organizations should have a clear understanding of the laws and
regulations in each country in which they operate. They should also have a robust compliance framework in place,
including regular training and monitoring to ensure that employees are aware of and adhere to the requirements.
Regulations across multiple jurisdictions have a lot in common, however, some details are different. Neglecting or
overlooking details can lead to non-compliance and potential legal consequences.</p>
<p>In summary, managing compliance for multiple jurisdictions can be challenging, organizations face significant
compliance challenges when it comes to data privacy, information security, money laundering, and the financing of
terrorism, particularly when operating in different countries. They should have a robust compliance program in place,
including regular training and monitoring, to ensure they are compliant. Organizations should have a clear
understanding of the laws and regulations in each country in which they operate.</p>
<p>SimpliFi, the leading Cards as a Service (CaaS) platform for MENA and Pakistan has a robust and strong compliance
framework in place to ensure compliance with laws and regulations across all the countries in which we operate.</p>
<p>We have a dedicated team of experts who stay up-to-date on the latest laws and regulations, as we have implemented a
variety of tools and processes to ensure compliance at all times. SimpliFi is fully committed to maintaining the
highest standards of compliance with all regulations and standards, and we will continue to invest in the necessary
tools and resources to maintain that level of compliance.</p>

<p><strong>A Virtual Card</strong> is a payment card that exists solely in electronic form. It consists of a unique, randomly-
generated 16-digit number and contains the exact card details as their physical counterparts: expiration date and
CVV code. A virtual card mimics the function of a physical card to be used anywhere credit/debit cards are accepted.</p>
<h4>How Do Virtual Cards Work?</h4>
<p>Although commonly associated with online payments, virtual cards can be used to pay for any purchase – online or
offline. When using a virtual card to pay your suppliers, customers, or workers, cards can be used the same way
physical cards are used at a point-of-sale terminal or entered online.</p>
<h4>Virtual cards can be either disposable (one-time use) or multiple-use.</h4>
<p>Virtual credit or debit cards can be restricted to a single-use – which is referred to as disposable virtual cards.
In some cases, virtual card numbers are generated for specific purchases with predefined amounts and frequency of use.
Once generated, cards can be revoked as soon as a transaction is complete.</p>
<p>For B2B payments, you can set up a virtual card for every vendor or supplier. A virtual card number can be assigned
exclusively to one supplier and turned off once a purchase is complete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, multiple-use cards are assigned with an expiration date and can be reused until the date is
reached. Multiple-use cards can be used for subscription services or any other type of recurring payment.</p>
<h4>Combating Fraud With Virtual Cards – Using Modern Card Issuing</h4>
<p>With more companies, like yours, moving their services into the digital realm, fraudsters are figuring out new ways
to take advantage of the world of digital payments. No matter what business or industry you’re in, it’s time to give
payment security some serious thought with cyber fraud on the rise.</p>
<p>Virtual cards offer an ideal way to keep your business accounts secure and cybercriminals out of your wallet. These
cards are becoming increasingly common among consumers, and businesses are now catching up.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In 2025, the volume of virtual card transactions will rise to $5 trillion from $1.6 trillion in 2020</strong> – Juniper Research</p>
<hr>
<p>Virtual cards enable secure online transactions by allowing you to take preemptive measures to combat fraud. Card
programs created through modern card issuing providers like SimpliFi provide fine-grained controls on when, where,
and how payments can be made.</p>
<p>Just like any card program created on a modern card issuing platform, spend controls can restrict the use of virtual
cards. Cards can be created for a one-time payment for a specific amount, time, place, or merchant category where the
card is accepted. These controls are verified as transactions take place to prevent attempts of card misuse.</p>
<p><em>SimpliFi''s modern card issuing APIs can help you design virtual card programs in ways that meet your
specific business needs.</em></p>

<p>KYC is one of the most important terms in Fintech, and the financial ecosystem at large.
What is KYC, you ask?
In this blog post, we explore what KYC is all about and what fintech owners need to know.</p>
<h4>What is KYC, really?</h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>In Short</strong></p>
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a set of standards used by fintechs, banks, and other financial institutions to verify a
customer’s legal identity.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Let’s explain more…</strong></p>
<h4>The Essence of KYC</h4>
<p>&#8220;Prevention is better than cure&#8221;, they say.</p>
<p>KYC lies at the heart of fraud prevention. The main goal revolves around fraud prevention and constraining the ability
of some users who fail to meet the given acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>KYC verification procedures allow financial service providers to avoid working with customers involved in
<a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism">money laundering</a>,
<a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism">terrorist financing</a>,
or other illicit financial activities.</p>
<p>Serving as a line of defense against fraudulent activities, KYC procedures are often done at the time of customer
onboarding – where identity documents are validated before customer approval. In other words, KYC is required any time a
fintech accepts a new customer. An identity check will be executed and in some cases, additional customer key personal
data and documents will be requested by the financial service provider.</p>
<hr>
<p>KYC measurements can be further broken down into three levels: SDD, CDD, and EDD.</p>
<p>Each client is evaluated for possible participation in financial crimes and assigned a certain rating – referred to as
‘Risk Rating’.</p>
<h4>KYC Risk Rating</h4>
<ul>
<li>SDD – Standard Due Diligence (Low Risk)<br>This is the lowest level of verification and a faster due diligence process that identifies low-risk clients. When
there is little chance of money laundering or terrorist financing, SDD is used.</li>
<li>CDD – Customer Due Diligence (Medium Risk)<br>Customer Due Diligence is a basic analysis of the client and is the most common form of KYC. It is a medium-risk
sphere within fintech that focuses on risk assessment and understanding the customer’s transaction habits.</li>
<li>EDD – Enhanced Due Diligence (High Risk)<br>Enhanced Due Diligence, or EDD, is very common with Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), or customers who are more
likely to participate in financial crimes – due to the nature of their business/operations. EDD will require fintech
firms to collect additional data for high-risk customers’ identity and business operations – data on wealth sources,
press coverage of the customer, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these processes is followed by continuous monitoring and transaction documentation – especially in high-security
cases.</p>
<p>Without these procedures in place, overseeing financial bodies would have a hard time tracking illicit activities and
stopping them.</p>
<h4>What are the challenges that you might face in the KYC process?</h4>
<p>Given the prevalence of cybercrime and its ever-changing practices, staying in compliance with KYC requirements can be
challenging for a fintech startup.</p>
<p>KYC is an ongoing process. A fintech is required to regularly reassess its clients’ risk levels. To protect your fintech
business from regulatory sanctions, fraud attacks, and chargebacks, it is crucial to implement a KYC risk assessment for
all your customers.</p>
<p>Between due diligence, risk management, and continual analysis of transactions, fintechs spend a lot on KYC compliance
annually.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Global spend on financial crime compliance – including KYC and transaction monitoring – at financial institutions
reached <a href="https://risk.lexisnexis.com/global/en/about-us/press-room/press-release/20210609-tcoc-global-study">$213.9 Billion</a>
in 2021.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, these budgetary restraints aren’t uniform across the board.</p>
<p>Therefore, fintech startups are likely to struggle – especially if new to the market or fundraising.</p>

<p>Open-loop means any payment method can be used to make payments without having to be part of the system itself. Any card
that is widely accepted at multiple merchant stores and locations is considered an open loop card.</p>
<p>Open loop cards can come in a multitude of forms. Open loop cards can be credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, or
prepaid cards. The most common example is a credit card processed by a renowned
<a href="/what-is-a-card-scheme">card scheme</a>, like Visa or Mastercard.</p>
<p>The advantages of open loop cards include high scalability and versatile transactions that are universally accepted.
Card holders can make purchases anywhere in the world across multiple merchants where card payments are accepted,
including online and over the phone.</p>
<p>When we refer to payment cards, open loop and closed loop, are systems that indicate whether a payment card can be used
at online or offline stores other than that of the card issuer.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between open loop &amp; closed loop payment system?</h4>
<p>Closed loop payment systems do not offer as much flexibility as open loop.</p>
<p>While open-loop payment systems enable cardholders to make purchases anywhere, closed-loop cards are issued to be used
at particular merchant stores only.</p>
<p>Most store gift or branded cards, such as the <a href="https://www.alshaya.com/en/customer-zone/the-alshaya-card/">The Alshaya Card</a>,
can only be used at the issuing stores, limiting purchases to the issuing retailer, and are therefore closed-loop cards.</p>
<p>However, not all store-branded cards are or need to be closed loop, organizations can create all sorts of co-branded
payment cards via partnerships with financial institutions or <a href="/modern-card-issuing">modern card issuing</a> providers
like <a href="/">SimpliFi</a>, enabling payment acceptance globally at multiple merchants.</p>

<p>In 2022, people and businesses continue to use payment cards every day – if not several times a day. Cards, whether
physical or virtual, are the essence of digital payments.</p>
<p>However, evolving business models and the emergence of a variety of new business requirements and payment options
requires new opportunities and card innovations that businesses cannot find at traditional retail banks.</p>
<p>Luckily, new innovative payment card options have also emerged to meet the demand that can’t be met or satisfied by
traditional banks or legacy systems.</p>
<p>These innovative payment card solutions are created and enabled by modern card issuing platforms and APIs with the
purpose of powering a new era of flexible payment card options.</p>
<p>But where can you find these platforms? And how can organizations use them to build successful card offerings?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to create a successful payment card product for your business and find a modern card
issuing platform for your business needs.</p>
<h4>Card Issuing: Banks vs. Modern Fintech</h4>
<p>When it comes to card issuance, banks are the go-to. They’re the most popular – and for a long time the ‘only’ – issuers
of cards in the world.</p>
<p>But fast forward to today, banks are now seen as these big entities with stringent requirements, lots of legal
processes, and in many cases not flexible or scalable enough to support some modern-day business use cases.</p>
<p>Even more so, banks can’t offer the flexibility that innovative companies, like Uber, Talabat, and others, need when it
comes to payments today.</p>
<p>As a result, companies like SimpliFi had to come up with ways to help companies scale payments by enabling issuing cards
faster and providing more controls.</p>
<p>That’s what modern card issuing is all about.</p>
<p>By providing the necessary infrastructure, platforms like SimpliFi, help organizations to build highly configurable
payment cards to facilitate and enable innovative payment experiences.</p>
<p>In addition, modern card issuers like SimpliFi, help businesses manage card programs in ways that legacy systems can’t –
and probably never will.</p>
<p>In other words, if you want to know how to issue a virtual card or physical card without having to go through bank
hassles and approvals, then keep reading.</p>
<h4>How to launch a winning payment card program</h4>
<p>Having a successful payment card program for your business means your employees can enjoy flexible payment solutions
that make their jobs easier, faster, and more efficient.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can also offer your customers card options, whether as your main solution or as an addition to
your overall service.</p>
<p>With modern card issuance, the ideas and opportunities are endless.</p>
<p>Here are 9 things you need to do to create, design, and launch a successful payment card program in your company.</p>
<p>The tips included here cover launching a card both to support your employees and internal systems and to provide
additional benefits to your customers.</p>
<h4>1. Determine your business goals</h4>
<p>The first step in making any business decision is to identify your business needs and how you plan to acquire customers.
Doing so will help you determine which platform and payment card solution works for you best.</p>
<p>By identifying your goals, you’ll also be able to – at least initially – determine the metrics needed to measure the
success of your card issuing program.</p>
<h4>2. Identify your target audience and their behavior</h4>
<p>One of the most important steps is identifying who the target audience for your card issuance program is.</p>
<p>Is it your employees? Your customers? Both?</p>
<p>If it’s the latter, then it’s best to divide your card program into two layers or segments. You may even divide your
larger segments into sub-segments and note down usage policies and specifications for each. When it comes to customers,
create a customer profile with demographics and behaviors such as when they make purchases, where they make them, along
with the type of businesses they frequent.</p>
<h4>3. Identify pain points</h4>
<p>The next step is designing your payment card solution to identify the pain points in your business and your customers’
or employees’ pain points.</p>
<p>Doing so means you’ll be able to clearly work on your card solution so that you can clear away bottlenecks and ensure a
smooth process later on.</p>
<p>In this section, make sure you write everything down. From pressing problems all the way to minor issues.</p>
<p>Is there something that may hinder your growth in the future? Is there something your competitors are doing that you
aren’t and that’s affecting your business?</p>
<p>Write it all down.</p>
<h4>4. Identify your geographies and audiences</h4>
<p>Once you’ve identified your needs and pain points, it’s time to determine which geographical locations your employees or
customers can use your cards in.</p>
<p>You can also set up markets or industries where your cards can be used, spending limits, and other related policies.</p>
<p>Planning your geographies should also include where your target audience is and where you’d like to expand – as a
business and service – in the future.</p>
<h4>5. Specify the services your cards can perform</h4>
<p>Now it’s time to focus on what your card can do and how and where they help customers. This section can focus on
specific industries, include ideas, or simply show how customers benefit from your card program.</p>
<h4>6. Is your card program part of your business model?</h4>
<p>You should definitely consider if your card is part of a larger service or service of its own. Is it part of your
business model? And if yes, how much does your card program contribute to your revenues?</p>
<p>This will include both estimates and actual figures that you’ll need to review on a monthly, quarterly, and annual
basis.</p>
<p>If the card is the core of your business model, or an essential part of it – then you shouldn’t focus on contributions
but instead compare and review how much your card program is in-line with your objectives and overall revenues.</p>
<h4>7. Ensure your policies are working well</h4>
<p>It’s unlikely you’ll get everything right the first time. So, once you launch your card, you’ll need a couple of weeks
of trial-and-error to help you fine-tune your policies.</p>
<p>Use the dashboard offered by your modern card issuing provider to track spending and money movements, uncover where
customers and employees are falling short or not completing their tasks. Then fine-tune your card program accordingly.</p>
<h4>8. Train employees and customers to use your card</h4>
<p>When creating a payment card program, you should always have an onboarding process. Better yet, a quick onboarding video
will save you valuable time and will be available for customers and employees to see whenever they want to.</p>
<p>Based on the initial trial, you can refine your onboarding process for how different people can use your payment card.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important steps when launching a payment card program. Failing to onboard customers and/or
employees can result in many negative experiences and results.</p>
<p>For employees, failure to correctly onboard them means more time spent by employees, wasted spend, longer processes,
lots of frustration, and more.</p>
<p>For customers, a negative experience can translate into bad reviews and less business.</p>
<h4>9. Find the right partner to team up with</h4>
<p>Last but certainly not least, it’s time to find the right modern card issuing program provider that will meet your
requirements and act as a supportive partner to your business.</p>
<h4>Launching your Card Offering</h4>
<p>Launching a payment card offering on your own is neither simple nor straight forward. For starters, there are a host of
regulatory approvals and industry requirements a business has to go through.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are enablers, like SimpliFi, a payment card enabler that helps companies issue cards easily, while taking
care of the regulatory headache and requirements.</p>

<p>The magic of seamless, nearly invisible payments is spreading everywhere – on e-commerce sites, investing platforms,
music apps, and brick and mortar stores. Everywhere where customers spend their time and money.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing is giving businesses new ways to manage corporate spend, increase employee satisfaction and stay at
the heart of customers’ financial lives.</p>
<p>With the help of modern card issuing platforms and their open APIs, cards continue to be a key touchpoint to smarter
financial services – catalyzing new commerce, business, and payment landscape.</p>
<hr>
<p>For over half a century, the traditional bank-led card programs have dominated the card-issuing landscape.</p>
<p>Cards issued by banks are characterized as one-size-fits-all products with limited features – many of which simply don’t
serve the ever-changing needs of consumers and businesses around the world.</p>
<p>Fintechs have begun to emerge to deliver experiences that meet the needs of modern consumers and businesses. They have
started building flexible, customized platforms, by embedding payments in their flows such as virtual cards with
customized controls.</p>
<h4>Modern Card Issuing – Paving the way for more accessible financial services</h4>
<p>Today, innovative businesses are looking for ways to issue their own cards, setting up custom payment programs while
bypassing traditional, burdensome card-issuing methods.</p>
<p>Features like OEM wallet payments such as Apple Pay, custom spend controls, and rich user data insights are on top of
mind.</p>
<p>Pioneered by companies like Uber and IKEA, modern card issuing now allows businesses to have their own configurable
payment cards and a simpler way to manage payment programs.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing platforms – that have already established partnerships and direct integration points with issuing
banks and card networks – can help organizations build card programs to issue cards in a matter of a few clicks.
<strong><em>These platforms are often distinguished by:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Open APIs:</strong> A card issuing platform with open APIs enables businesses to develop their own card solution, tailored to
specific business needs and logic. When the needs expand to new use cases, open APIs will allow organizations to modify
and customize their card experience.</p>
<p><strong>Programmatic Controls:</strong> Using modern card issuing, businesses can specify exactly when, where, and how cards will be
used – to reduce fraud risks and prevent unauthorized or excess spending. Card spending options can be limited by
merchant name/category, channel, location, spending amount, and time of use.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time Transaction Data:</strong> Having visibility into transaction data can give businesses access to consumer spending
habits including the purchase amount, merchant, location, date, time, and currency. These rich, data-driven insights
will provide a full picture of consumers’ behavior.</p>

<p>Tokenization has become a major buzzword these days and is often mentioned in the same breath as data security,
blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs.</p>
<p>In payments, tokens play an integral role in adding an extra level of security to sensitive payment card data.</p>
<p>In this article, we will answer your question ‘What is payment tokenization?’, and take a closer look at the concept of
tokenization in the payments ecosystem.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s dive right in.</p>
<hr>
<h4>What is Tokenization in simple terms?</h4>
<p>In the simplest terms, tokenization is the process of securing sensitive data by exchanging it for a non-sensitive
equivalent.</p>
<hr>
<p>When applied to data security, tokenization is the act of substituting sensitive data with surrogate values – called
tokens – that have no exploitable meaning or value.</p>
<p>These tokens are the reference, or identifiers, that map back to the original, sensitive data.</p>
<h4>What is Payment Tokenization?</h4>
<p>In the payments industry, tokenization is used to safeguard a card’s PAN
(<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primary-account-number-pan.asp">Primary Account Number</a>) by exchanging it with
more secure data.</p>
<p>The key strength of tokenization as a security measure, lies in the fact that card PAN numbers are not transmitted
during transactions. When tokenized cards are used for payments, actual card details are held safe in a secure digital
vault, and tokens are used instead of exposing sensitive data.</p>
<p>If a fraudster tries to intercept a transaction, all they will find is useless tokens, not any real card information.</p>
<h4>Types of Tokenization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Security tokenization<br>Traditionally, security tokenization – also referred to as non-payment or acquirer tokenization – has been used to
protect cardholder data and personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
</ul>
<p>When payment transactions are complete, security tokens are designed to protect sensitive information when ‘at rest’
within a merchant’s database. This involves acquirer processors tokenizing cards using specific token formats, helping
merchants protect sensitive data and meet PCI requirements. Credentials can be stored for future, recurring payments,
and seamless checkout experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Network tokenization<br>Network tokenization is a type of payment card tokenization offered by the payments network—Visa, Mastercard,
Discover, American Express, etc.—that replaces primary account numbers (PANs) and other card details with a token
issued by the card brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>When implemented properly, network tokenization ensures secure remote commerce throughout the payments ecosystem by
removing the need for merchants or third-party providers (Known as Token requestors i.e. ApplePay, GooglePay,,etc.) to
expose themselves to the risk of handling the raw PAN and other sensitive cardholder data.</p>
<p><a href="/">SimpliFi</a> helps its clients launch tokenized card products which can be provisioned on ApplePay,
GooglePay, etc. with minimal overhead work required by its clients.</p>
<h4>What Does a Token Look Like?</h4>
<p>Token formats are categorized as: Format preserving or non-format preserving.</p>
<p><em>Format-preserving tokens</em> maintain the look and feel of original card data.</p>
<p>On the contrary, non-format preserving tokens do not resemble the data in original cards and might also include
alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p><em>To illustrate:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Format Preserving</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<p><strong>Original Card Number</strong></p>
<p>1222 1111 1111 2222</p>
<p><strong><em>Format Preserving Token</em></strong></p>
<p>1222 7546 3498 2222</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-format Preserving</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Original Card Number</em></strong></p>
<p>1222 1111 1111 2222</p>
<p><strong><em>Non-format Preserving Token</em></strong></p>
<p>2e5ghfjf-te635yr-7637eb-u9jy76</p>
<hr>
<h4>Tokenization AND PCI Compliance</h4>
<p>According to the PCI DSS, &#8220;Tokenization solutions do not eliminate the need to maintain and validate PCI DSS compliance,
but they may simplify a merchant’s validation efforts by reducing the number of system components for which PCI DSS
requirements apply&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this case, tokenization can be considered as a best practice to reduce PCI compliance scope – thus reducing the costs
involved with meeting and monitoring PCI requirements.</p>
<p>It is simply one ingredient of an entire data security program that could qualify an organization for a PCI compliance
certification.</p>

<p>In any given payment card transaction there are multiple entities involved in the processing of those transactions- one
of the fundamental entities found in the process is the <strong><em>Card Scheme</em></strong>.</p>
<h4>What is a Card Scheme?</h4>
<p>A card scheme is a payment network that processes payments made on prepaid, credit, and debit cards. Its primary role is
to connect payors with payees by acting as a trusted party and managing payment transactions, including authorization,
clearing, and settlement. Transactions are managed according to a set of procedures, rules, and arrangements that allow
cardholders to buy products and services from retailers and other service providers.</p>
<p>Card schemes serve as a fundamental part of payment processes, making online and offline purchases possible without the
need for cash or cheques.</p>
<p>As consumers, we use these schemes day in and day out in spite of the fact that there is no direct relationship between
the card scheme and us – the consumer. Banks and other financial institutions are members of card schemes like Visa or
Mastercard which allows them to issue payment cards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blogs/009-01.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>How Does a Card Scheme Work?</h4>
<p>Card schemes use a set of unique rules and procedures to transfer transaction information from the acquiring bank to the
issuing bank.</p>
<p>Once a payment card is tapped, swiped, or inserted in a POS terminal, or through an online payment system, a certain
pathway of communication opens up. This pathway is between the card scheme, the issuing bank, and the acquiring bank –
representing how cardholder data is stored, processed, and transmitted in order for a transaction to go through.</p>
<p>As consumers tap their cards to pay, card schemes send authorization requests to cardholder’s bank – validating card
details provided and ensuring sufficient funds are available in cardholder’s account. Once authorized, card schemes send
information back to the acquiring bank. Transactions are settled typically overnight and funds are released and placed
into the merchant’s account.</p>
<p>In short, card schemes are an essential component of successful transactions, connecting merchants and financial
institutions to authorize transactions and facilitate the transfer of funds.</p>

<p>For decades, legacy payment infrastructure has enabled the payment of goods and services globally, reliably and
securely. However, with the rise of new and complex business models, a one-size-fits-all architecture can no longer
serve the demands of today''s sophisticated use cases.</p>
<p>That''s why innovators are turning to modern card issuing solutions to provide payment experiences that ensure the
success and growth of these emerging business models.</p>
<h4>What is Modern Card Issuing?</h4>
<p>Modern card issuing is a more flexible and secure way to issue payment cards. Usually delivered through open APIs,
modern card issuing solutions empower businesses to customize, build and run card programs at scale.</p>
<p>These solutions enable flexible embedded payment experiences that have been difficult to provide with legacy frameworks
and architectures. Modern card issuing removes the roadblocks for businesses looking to deliver unique business models
and payment experiences in a scalable, flexible and secure manner whilst ensuring quick time to market with limited
investment.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Modern Card Issuing Use Cases for Merchants &amp; Retailers</h4>
<p>Using card-issuing APIs, businesses can create customizable, branded, physical and virtual cards to serve multiple
scenarios and use cases.</p>
<p>Here are 4 modern card issuing use cases that merchants and retailers can leverage to scale their payments:</p>
<h4>Use case 1: BNPL &amp; Virtual Cards</h4>
<p>Buy now, pay later has become one of the most in-demand financing options around the world, sweeping the consumer
landscape. Today, customers can buy now and pay later for just about anything and everything. As the name suggests, this
kind of financing provides customers with point-of-sale installment loans to purchase items and pay for them in small
installments – breaking up the cost over predefined time periods.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing is an easy way for BNPL platforms to provide their customers with BNPL payment options through
instantly issued virtual cards. To illustrate, when a customer initiates a BNPL purchase at a merchant''s store or
online, a card is issued to pay the merchant instantly and is accepted through a standard POS system. This creates a
seamless onboarding experience for the merchant since complex POS integration is not required beforehand and the BNPL
platform can scale on the back of the payment acceptance networks.</p>
<h4>Use Case 2: Consumer Spend Cards</h4>
<p>More businesses across various industries are implementing payments as a core part of their business model to stay at
the heart of their customers'' financial lives.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing APIs can provide merchants such as retail marketplaces with increased visibility into customer
spending patterns and lifestyles to gain in-depth actionable insights. By collecting more data on how, when, and where
customers are spending their money, merchants can provide more relevant, tailored offerings to enrich customer
experiences.</p>
<h4>Use Case 3: Corporate Payout Cards</h4>
<p>Merchants can conveniently pay employees, workers, contractors, and suppliers by pushing funds to cards that they issue.
Modern card issuing provides an alternative method for payroll, enabling organizations to pay salaries on reloadable
prepaid cards. This helps today''s B2B organizations adapt to emerging trends like remote workforces, gig economies, and
supply chain diversification.</p>
<p>It''s not just that. When it comes to merchant-supplier disbursements, modern card issuing facilitates supplier payments
and breaks down the amount of complexity in a typical B2B payment process. Online and offline merchants and retailers
can quickly onboard suppliers and provide them with instant access to their money through prepaid cards.</p>
<h4>Use case 4: Corporate spend cards</h4>
<p>Corporate expenses and reimbursements can be painfully troublesome for both employers and employees alike.</p>
<p>The challenge lies in how employees can receive the money and transact, and the ability of employers to place controls
to align employee spending to corporate policy. Modern card issuing resolves both issues.</p>
<p>Dynamic spend controls for virtual and physical cards can monitor spend and approve transactions in real-time. These
controls can be set to restrict spending options to specific channels, and/or different user groups or individuals, or
by different amounts for different merchant category codes.</p>
<p>Across numerous industries, merchants and retailers can now create next-generation payment experiences that set them
apart. Looking to launch a card program for your business? Learn more here.</p>

<p>The global market for on-demand food delivery services is projected to reach
<a href="https://www.marketresearch.com/Global-Industry-Analysts-v1039/Online-Demand-Food-Delivery-Services-14404871/">$259.7 billion</a>
by 2027, growing at a global CAGR of 29.4% over the period 2020-2027.</p>
<p>The global food delivery space has been tackling various ongoing challenges since its inception – even as it continues
to expand, the commercial model and economics are still evolving. The Middle East online food delivery market is heating
up as well in response to soaring customer demand.</p>
<p>On-demand delivery concepts and food disruptors have been emerging in the Middle East integrating online platforms with
offline stores.</p>
<p><strong>The overall on-demand food delivery market in the Middle East has
<a href="https://blog.measurable.ai/2021/05/11/the-rise-of-food-delivery-market-in-the-middle-east/">doubled</a> in revenue in
2020, with Saudi Arabia having the highest revenue growth rate.</strong> Global players, like Deliveroo, and homegrown players
including Talabat and Mrsool, are all striving to stay relevant in an ultra-competitive market.</p>
<p>As the industry continues to develop, payments innovation and operational efficiency will become key factors for
long-term success for the various players in the region.</p>
<p>In search of operational efficiency, innovative companies are starting to overhaul their existing payment
infrastructure, replacing inflexible systems with modern card issuing platforms.</p>
<hr>
<h4>What are Modern card issuing platforms?</h4>
<p>Modern card issuing platforms are end-to-end platforms that enable organizations to create, distribute, and manage
physical and/or virtual cards using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_API">open APIs</a>.</p>
<p>But how can this power the on-demand food delivery market?</p>
<p>Let''s dive right in.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The working principle of on-demand food delivery platforms is solely based on a network of several parties including the
customer, the merchant, the aggregator, and the delivery partner.</em> Essentially, all these parties need to be constantly
incentivized and empowered to sustain operations on the same platform.</p>
<p>On-demand food delivery companies can partner with modern card issuing providers to give better experiences to their
customers, streamline operations and drive profitability.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing enables on-demand delivery companies to overcome long-standing payment challenges by maximizing
control over daily operations and driver-related payments.</p>
<p>Today, food delivery companies have a golden opportunity to unlock use cases that have never been served before.</p>
<p>With the help of open APIs, companies can issue their own cards to delivery couriers that can be used to process
payments just like any other point-of-sale transaction. This way, delivery companies can scale with an ever-expanding
restaurant selection without payment settlement becoming a bottleneck – enabling delivery drivers to rely on modern card
payment technology to pick up and pay for food for hungry customers on tight schedules.</p>
<h4>How Modern Card Issuance addresses common payment pain points in on-demand food delivery</h4>
<p>Many food delivery orders require point-of-sale payments. This means that food pickup payments are settled either
directly between the platform and merchants or drivers have to pay for the order using their own payment methods when
picking it up at the store.</p>
<p>For settlement between the platform and restaurant, platforms have to build extensive financial operations teams to
reconcile and process payments which means restaurants don''t get paid for days or weeks.</p>
<p>And if the driver has to pay out of his pocket then that is constrained by the cash that he carries on him which in turn
depends on how quickly he gets reimbursed for those orders. What if the driver after accepting an order didn''t have
enough cash to fulfill the order? Well, this might result in an unfulfilled order, a disappointed customer, and
consequently, missing out on a sale. And a lost sale means losing a customer as well, whether their order was small or
large.</p>
<p>Cards are essential to enable delivery drivers to always be in the money and fulfill orders when they don''t have cash in
their pockets.</p>
<p><em>But how does modern card issuance differ from traditional card issuing?</em></p>
<p>Older legacy card issuing methods are too complex and require lengthy and costly processes – slowing the onboarding of
new drivers. This, as a result, will prevent companies in this ecosystem from meeting the surge in demand for on-demand
delivery services.</p>
<p>Mrsool''s order revenue in 2020 is <a href="https://blog.measurable.ai/2021/05/11/the-rise-of-food-delivery-market-in-the-middle-east/">more than five times that of 2019</a>,
rising from 59% in Q3 of 2019 to 77% in Q1 2021.</p>
<p>To meet the crush of orders, many on-demand delivery companies are scrambling and working 24/7 to hire thousands of
delivery couriers and operations associates.</p>
<p>Modern card issuing is enabling on-demand delivery companies to thrive in a crowded market with fierce competition.</p>
<p>Using modern card issuing platforms and their open APIs, cards can make it into the hands of drivers in short time
frames. The faster these cards are in the hands of new drivers, the faster they can begin fulfilling orders. Once
drivers pass a background check, they are good to go.</p>
<h4>On-demand delivery companies need modern card issuing to:</h4>
<p><strong>• Gain control over driver payments</strong></p>
<p>Modern card issuing platforms not only make it possible for on-demand delivery companies to get physical and virtual
cards in the hands of new drivers quickly, but they also add security layers. This additional security is even more
important today given the rising volume of <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2020/200320.aspx">fraud</a>.</p>
<p>In an on-demand delivery case, companies can issue cards for their couriers with predefined spending controls — for
example, restaurant ID and the exact total amount of purchase — to avoid card misuse at other restaurants or fraudulent
add-ons. Restricting when, where, and how these cards are used provides additional protection and ensures cards are used
for their intended purpose.</p>
<p><strong>• Generate new revenue streams</strong></p>
<p>Business expenses can be turned into a revenue generator. By issuing cards through modern card issuing platforms,
companies will be able to generate new revenue streams by earning transaction fees on every card payment made by
delivery drivers.</p>
<p><strong>• Obtain end-to-end insights</strong></p>
<p>Through modern card issuance, delivery companies can gain end-to-end, real-time insights over every transaction to help
them and their restaurants learn more about delivery preferences – to better serve end customers'' needs and wants.</p>

<p>According to a study carried out by <a href="https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/global/run-your-business/documents/visa-direct-gig-research-infographic.pdf">Visa</a>,
77% of the surveyed gig workers endure times where they need money and only 12% describe themselves as financially
secure.</p>
<p>The challenge for gig companies today is to recruit and nourish their gig workforce as a long-term, dedicated pool of
labor. As gig economy companies look to retain their workforce relationships, addressing payment needs to empower a
financially healthy gig workforce will help them gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>To secure the services and skills of the most sought-after gig economy workers, key payment facilitation issues need to
be addressed.</p>
<h4>Gig Payment Challenges and Inefficiencies</h4>
<p><strong>Gig workers experience unreliable demand fluctuations for their work</strong>, making income volatility a major challenge for
this group of people.</p>
<p>For instance, during the Covid-19 lockdown, consumer demand for home delivery skyrocketed while their interest in
ride-sharing dropped due to health concerns. These inconsistencies can lead to substantial swings in income from one
month to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Another key challenge with gig worker payments is the likelihood of receiving untimely and delayed payments</strong>. Traditional
bank and wallet-based transfers that rely on batch processing and third parties increase the time between when a gig
worker delivers work and when they receive payments. This makes it difficult for gig workers to access their earned
wages instantaneously and fulfill their recurring financial obligations in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.thinkforwardinitiative.com/research/living-gig-to-gig-and-paycheque-to-paycheque-how-income-volatility-affects-financial-decisions">Think Forward Initiative report</a>
shows that workers who experience such challenges encounter more financial stress, lower savings, and difficulty making
ends meet.</p>
<p>Organizations and gig platforms need to replace their complex, slow, and costly payment processing methods with
real-time payments to ensure immediate payment transfers and settlements.</p>
<p>Gig workers are increasingly craving efficient and flexible payment experiences. In fact,
<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/if-every-day-was-payday-making-the-gig-economy-work-smarter/">85%</a>
of the gig workforce is willing to work more often if they could get paid faster.</p>
<h4>Modern card issuance: Fostering Lasting Relationships with Gig Workers</h4>
<p><strong>By directly addressing long-standing gig payment inefficiencies, payment solutions capitalizing on real-time
capabilities can help businesses a) elevate gig worker experience b) foster loyalty, and c) reduce costs of attracting
and retaining gig talent.</strong></p>
<p>So, how can your business reap these benefits? Through <strong>Modern card issuance</strong>.</p>
<p>Modern card issuance is a secure and flexible way of issuing cards by creating customizable, flexible card programs
through open APIs. Your organization can issue and fund cards instantly to provide workers with immediate access to
their earned wages.</p>
<p>Receiving payments quickly and seamlessly as soon as the job is completed is a great motivator for gig workers.
Real-time, on-demand gig worker payouts can help build loyalty and engagement. According to a survey conducted by Visa
and Directions Research, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/global/run-your-business/documents/visa-direct-gig-research-infographic.pdf">over half</a>
of the surveyed gig workers prefer real-time payouts.</p>
<p>What''s more, using modern card issuance solutions, organizations can issue their own branded cards, which can further
deepen the relationship with gig workers on your team. In addition, through programmable features, companies can not
only automate payouts but also customize them such as the timing of the payout and % of the amount paid by linking them
to the rating of the gig worker or his tenure.</p>
<p>Embracing payment platforms that address gig workers'' pain points through real-time money movement and a range of
flexible payment options allows your businesses to strengthen vital working relationships with gig workers and also
attract top talent.</p>
<p>Give workers the financial peace of mind they want with the speed and flexibility of Modern Card Issuing Platforms.

<p>RegTech is more than just a buzzword in the global financial and compliance community. So what is RegTech and why is it
gaining prominence?.</p>
<p>In simple terms, RegTech is the fusion of the words Regulatory and Technology.</p>
<p>RegTech is the technology that applies innovative capabilities and techniques to help financial institutions improve
regulatory governance, reporting, compliance, and risk management. It is making the shift from just a fancy buzzword to
becoming a vital piece of the regulatory and compliance landscape.</p>
<h4>History of RegTech</h4>
<p>The history of RegTech can be categorized into three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RegTech 1.0 (1990):</strong> This comprised quantitative risk management practices that we are familiar with today.</li>
<li><strong>RegTech 2.0 (2000):</strong> Tools helping companies comply with regulations and improving supervision activities focusing on KYC.</li>
<li>and the industry is now on the verge of <strong>RegTech 3.0:</strong> Shifting from ‘know your customer'' to ‘know your data'' –
interpreting compliance-related data and improving predictability through AI to drive efficiencies and reduce risk.
RegTech is not new. However, like any other application of technology, it is developing rapidly due to the decreasing
costs of emerging tech, expansion of data, and a staggering increase in computing power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the 2008 financial crisis represented a turning point in the development of RegTech. The consequent regulatory
changes and technological developments have fundamentally changed the nature of financial markets, services, and
institutions.</p>
<p>Post-crisis fines have exceeded <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/misbehaving-banks-have-now-paid-204b-in-fines.html">US$200 billion</a>,
and the ongoing cost of regulation and compliance has become a primary  concern industry-wide – facilitating the
emergence of RegTech.</p>
<p>RegTech is disrupting the financial sector and in order to illustrate how, we need to deep dive into the main challenges
and pressure points faced by financial institutions that RegTech is meant to address:</p>
<p>Challenges faced by financial institutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing high costs of compliance</li>
<li>Introduction of additional financial regulations</li>
<li>Rising penalty fees on non-compliance with regulations</li>
<li>Legacy systems constraints due to insufficient automation &amp; digitization to meet the pace of regulatory changes</li>
<li>Incompatible systems resulting in insufficient integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>Current legacy solutions adopted by financial firms are ill-fitted to overcome such challenges and meet the stringent
requirements continuously passed down by regulators.</p>
<p>And so, the demand for regulatory frameworks that give rise to more granularity and transparency has skyrocketed in the
last few years.</p>
<p>The global RegTech market size is expected to grow from $7.6 billion in 2021 to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-regtech-market-size-expected-093000788.html">$19.5 billion</a>
by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.8%.</p>
<h4>Financial Institutions combating compliance and regulatory challenges with RegTech</h4>
<p>The time is NOW for the financial sector to explore the capabilities of AI-powered risk and compliance management
systems.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on big data and machine learning technologies, RegTech solutions analyze huge volumes of data from numerous
sources at high speeds. This slashes the time needed to carry out highly complex analyses and checks, catalyzing
improved productivity and efficiency gains.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.pwc.in/industries/financial-services/fintech/fintech-insights/regtech-a-new-disruption-in-the-financial-services-space.html">10–15%</a>
of the workforce in financial institutions is dedicated to regulatory compliance matters. RegTech solutions can automate
and streamline sophisticated tasks such as customer onboarding processes, enabling financial firms to potentially reduce
the time and compliance costs associated with such tasks by <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-companies-compliance.html">30-50%</a>,
according to Deloitte.</p>
<p>RegTech systems are paving the way for financial institutions to scale and adapt to the modern threat and regulatory
landscapes through <strong>a)</strong> Identifying suspicious activity more easily and <strong>b)</strong> accelerating risk detection and
remediation of complex cases.</p>

<p>In the past, issuing cards to customers was the product of a partnership between a large business and a bank – often
referred to as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/co-branded-card.asp">co-branded cards</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention, this involved high network and processing fees, bureaucratic and infrastructural barriers, and
geographic limitations.</p>
<p>But today, the emergence of CaaS business models has made card issuance an accessible pursuit for businesses.
Organizations can design, build and launch personalized card programs to match their desired customer experiences, at
scale.</p>
<p>Moreover, they can do it in WEEKS rather than months.</p>
<p>But What is <strong>CaaS?</strong></p>
<p>Read on to learn more.</p>
<h4>What is Card as a Service (CaaS)</h4>
<p>Card as a Service, or CaaS, is an up-and-coming card-issuing model that enables companies to easily develop and launch
card services as part of their business offering.</p>
<p>It is a modern-day approach for businesses to issue payment cards as a turnkey solution without the hassle of navigating
complex regulations, numerous partnerships, painstaking integrations and managing ongoing financial operations.</p>
<p>Simply put, CaaS providers offer comprehensive, out-of-the-box solutions for businesses, handling the entire end-to-end
card issuance process on their behalf – from managing all entities and processes across the value chain such as banks,
card schemes, processors, identity verification to card fulfillment and delivery.</p>
<p>As an enabler of modern card issuance, CaaS is becoming the key touchpoint facilitating smarter financial services.</p>
<p><strong>Modern card issuance</strong> is accelerating and streamlining the process of card creation. Using open APIs, and programmable
controls, businesses can customize their own card programs to enable new business models and unique digital experiences.</p>
<p>While modern card issuance can enable multiple use cases, issuing cards to customers empowers organizations to reap the
following benefits:</p>
<h4>Benefits of issuing your own cards: The Modern Way</h4>
<p>A win-win for you and your customers</p>
<p><strong>• Generate new revenue streams by monetising spending</strong></p>
<p>Issuing your own cards will allow you to monetise customer spending by realizing transaction fees every time they use
their cards.</p>
<p><strong>• Obtain valuable insights from increased visibility over customer data</strong></p>
<p>Modern card-issuing platforms grant you access to a complete set of APIs to gain visibility into valuable customer
spending data and key insights from customer lifestyles. These insights can form the building blocks for creating
personalized services to develop more meaningful customer relationships.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/b2b-cross-border-payment-transaction-values">Juniper study</a>,
the value of B2B cross-border payments will exceed $42.7 trillion in 2026, from $34 trillion in 2021. The main
contributor to this upsurging growth, as the research suggests, is <strong>cross-border e-commerce</strong> with a total value
expected to reach over <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/20/1904132/0/en/Global-Cross-Border-B2C-E-Commerce-Market-Will-Reach-Over-USD-4-856-1-Billion-By-2027-Zion-Market-Research.html">$4 trillion</a>
by 2027.</p>
<p>Although cross-border payments sit at the heart of international trade and economic activity, it acts as one of the key
roadblocks to global e-commerce business growth and success.</p>
<p>While the demand for cross-border commerce thrives, managing cross-border payments is still a challenge for most
organizations. Cross-border payment affairs can especially impede small merchants from expanding their businesses
overseas.</p>
<p>First, let''s define cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Cross-border payments are broadly defined as fund transfers for which the sender and the recipient are located in
different countries/jurisdictions. These transactions can be made between individuals, companies, banks, or
institutions.</p>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions have taken many initiatives to help bridge the gap and simplify the process.
However, traditional cross-border payment systems still have major pain points.</p>
<p>For this reason, Fintechs are transforming the current scene; re-inventing cross-border payments, by enabling faster,
easier, and more transparent international transactions.</p>
<p>In this article, we will deep dive into cross-border payment challenges, and how fintech APIs can help merchants combat
these challenges and seize the trillion-dollar opportunity.</p>
<h4>Cross-border Payments Challenges</h4>
<p><strong>1. Slow transactions</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, cross-border transactions take between two to five days to process, and even longer for some
less-developed markets. This counts as a very slow turnaround time compared to instant domestic payments
transactions. That''s because numerous entities and intermediaries are involved with every single transaction, which
results in a series of steps often delaying the transfer of payments.</p>
<p><strong>2. Transparency</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, organizations and merchants of all shapes and sizes want better visibility over financial transactions and
movement across their business, and cross-border transactions have been far from transparent.</p>
<p>A SWIFT and EuroFinance survey found that <a href="https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/64-corporate-treasurers-ask-real-time-payments-tracking">64% of corporations want real-time payment tracking capabilities</a>,
while <a href="https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/64-corporate-treasurers-ask-real-time-payments-tracking">47% want better visibility</a>
into the costs and deductions involved.</p>
<p>A single cross-border transaction can go through multiple different intermediaries. As payments move across
international waters, fees accumulate passing by every intermediary along the way – with no reliable way of calculating
for that near future hidden cost.</p>
<p><strong>3. Security</strong></p>
<p>There is no single global regulatory body controlling cross-border transactions. Every country abides by its own set
of regulations. Therefore, the cross-border payment system is at risk of being hacked whenever money enters a country
with less-rigid security policies.</p>
<p>In the past, cross-border payment systems have suffered from high-level security breaches, like Bangladesh central
bank''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery">$81 million heist</a> in 2016. Security hackers used a
Federal Reserve Bank account in New York belonging to Bangladesh Bank to illegally transfer $1 Billion and successfully
managed to steal $81 million.</p>
<p><strong>4. High costs</strong></p>
<p>Sending money from one country to another through banks has always been notoriously expensive. Money is channeled
through several intermediaries, each of which charges a fee for its service – regulatory, SWIFT, chargeback, and FX
fees.</p>
<h4>Harnessing the Trillion-Dollar opportunity using Fintech APIs</h4>
<p><strong>This trillion-dollar cross-border e-commerce market is being shaken up by the rush of new entrants that promise to solve
long-standing pitfalls.</strong></p>
<p>Overcoming cross-border payment challenges and barriers is becoming easier every day, but exploring reliable
cross-border payment solutions is paramount to navigating the world of global commerce.</p>
<p>As the pandemic pushed the fast-forward button on innovation in payment systems, Fintech APIs are reducing the friction
and increasing the efficiency needed to make cross-border transactions feel more like domestic payments. That means
cutting down on transaction processing time, removing hidden costs, and mimicking the domestic payments experience.</p>
<p>Fintech APIs, through single API integrations, are setting a new standard of trading without borders, enabling faster &amp;
simpler transactions and a more transparent system of cross-border payments.</p>
<p>With real-time payment tracking and instant payment processing capabilities, Fintech APIs are making international
payments more accessible to small businesses and merchants.</p>

<p><em>With 100 billion in BNPL purchases in 2021, up from 24 billion in 2020 – Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) models have become
the poster child of the payments sector and one of the most popular payment methods for young consumers.</em></p>
<p>The global pandemic resulted in a spike in e-commerce growth and a not-so-pleasant decrease in disposable income. As a
result, popularity for BNPL boomed and merchants and retailers are looking to adopt BNPL offers across multiple business
lines. For consumers, it makes buying more accessible and for merchants, it opens up opportunities to sell more things,
to more people.</p>
<p>Although other sectors benefit from the BNPL adoption, E-commerce retailers currently control the majority of usage.
Retailers with BNPL APIs on their site are estimated to experience a 20-30% increase in conversion. The option to pay
for an item over a period of time without hidden cost is an excellent motivation to purchase more and also free up cash
for other expenses.</p>
<h4>How FinTech APIs became the catalyst to BNPL adoption</h4>
<p>It is easy to attribute the massive adoption of BNPL to COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown, cash crunch, and lifestyle
changes. However, doing that alone is underestimating the role of API-based infrastructure offered by fintech providers
to promote inclusiveness in the financial sector.</p>
<p>The ease of integration, scalability, and versatility of API models has made it very simple for BNPL providers to
integrate BNPL functionality and even simpler for merchants to provide BNPL payment methods for their products and/or
services all around the world.</p>
<p>Thanks to the development and modular nature of Fintech APIs, organizations can integrate and launch BNPL solutions in a
matter of minutes, with minimal internal business disruption and without specialized development teams.</p>
<p>Fund your customers in real-time through one-time disposable or reusable payment cards enabling them to make purchases
with ease without merchant tie-ups.</p>

<p>Businesses around the world rely on one of the three following methods to pay their workers and vendors: <strong>writing
checks, sending electronic payments, and presenting payment cards</strong>. Until today.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, a growing number of digitally-driven companies have discovered a new, better way to make
payments: Virtual cards.</p>
<p><em>What are virtual cards?</em></p>
<p>A virtual card works just like a physical card. It has all the same credentials as a physical payment card, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardholder Name</li>
<li>16-digit card number</li>
<li>CVC</li>
<li>Expiry Date</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual cards empower organizations with visibility and control overspending in the new and modern era of remote
working. A virtual card can be generated instantaneously either for an online one-time transaction or multiple recurring
ones. It can also be created for specific use cases such as payment for a certain subscription on a recurring basis or
for travel for a specific trip.</p>
<p>The controls that an organization can put on the cards can help it preserve its budget, minimize fraud risks, and
increase control over expenses. This is driving more businesses than ever to opt for virtual cards to manage their
finances.</p>
<h4>Food for thought: Imagine you run a food delivery business</h4>
<p><em>By using one-time virtual cards, you can program cards for the thousands of delivery drivers in your network with the
exact amount of each food pick-up, the location and the time. This allows for a high level of control and helps you
monitor transactions more easily.</em></p>
<p>Your business can benefit from virtual cards too</p>
<p><strong>1. Stay on top of vendor payments</strong></p>
<p>Create virtual cards with custom spending limits for each vendor or subscription service your business uses to avoid
overcharges and/or manage recurring fees.</p>
<p><strong>2. Manage card &amp; spend controls easily</strong></p>
<p>You can easily freeze virtual cards, as well as set spending limits, or program them for one-time usage. This way you
can control your budgets and limit how much your employees can spend. Limits can be mapped by job level, function,
geography etc. thereby allowing a high degree of flexibility and control on the spend depending on the user.</p>
<p><strong>3. Reduce Fraud Risks</strong></p>
<p>When multiple employees and vendors share corporate cards, organizations are exposed to higher fraud risks. Using
virtual cards can make electronic payments safer and more secure.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make online purchasing easier for high performing teams</strong></p>
<p>In a new world where teams need to be agile, facilitating quick and efficient purchases of products and services is
necessary. Virtual cards can be instantly issued and with automatic set budgets.</p>
<p><strong>5. Improve spending visibility and automation</strong></p>
<p>Virtual cards provide rich transaction data. Every expense charged on the card, receipt uploaded or any detail
entered can be shared with finance teams to easily track spending in real-time. This provides real-time visibility
into spending, enabling data-driven decisions that can streamline and automate different stages of the payment
process.</p>

<p>New fintechs are being born every day. But In a space that is getting crowded with dozens of startups entering the
market and billion-dollar giants running the show, it can be challenging to get your piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Before going any further with your Fintech idea, here are a few things you need to consider first.</p>
<h4>Quick Notes on Building Your Own Fintech Product – A Recipe For Success</h4>
<p>Entering the financial services industry is no walk in the park. Most fintech startups around the world are still
struggling to achieve profitability.</p>
<p>According
to <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/uk/pdf/2020/07/fintech-pulse-report-2020.pdf">Google Cloud''s fintech Focus Report</a>,
based on a survey sample size of 100 fintech startups, only 6% are breaking-even and 84% of the continuing businesses
reported increasing losses in their last financial year.</p>
<p>In order to navigate through the fintech ecosystem smoothly and build resilient solutions at scale, here are 3 crucial
themes you need to explore first.</p>
<p><strong>1. Regulations</strong></p>
<p>The increasing use of new technologies, often untested, in the financial services space introduces new risks and
regulators and supervisors have been taking specific actions in response to these risks. This has included the
development of international standards, revamping of domestic regulations and rules, and shifts in supervisory
priorities.</p>
<p>Firms entering the fintech space need to account for the ever-changing nature of regulation and supervision into their
strategies, business planning, governance, and risk management.</p>
<p>In order to successfully break into the fintech industry, you need to be well-acquainted with all local and cross-border
regulations of where you plan to do business.</p>
<p>Different countries have different fintech regulatory requirements. To set up a fintech business, some countries require
organizations to apply for specific licenses, while others have more general licensing requirements. The UAE &amp; Mexico
are examples of countries where fintech organizations must apply
for <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/mexicos-fintech-law-leading-new-trend-fintech-regulation">specific fintech licenses</a>
to meet regulatory compliance requirements. On the other hand, in the UK there is no legislation that is aimed
specifically at the fintech sector. Fintech businesses will be most likely regulated by the respective industry in which
the organization operates.</p>
<p>Designed to capture and monitor payment transaction details in real-time, RegTech can help you automate mundane
compliance tasks and reduce operational risk associated with meeting compliance obligations. Using Regtech tools you can
fully or partially automate regulatory compliance-related processes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Funding</strong></p>
<p>There are substantial investment opportunities for fintech startups today.</p>
<p>In 2021, fintech companies
attracted <a href="http://localhost:3180/building-a-succesful-fintech-solution/#:~:text=%2491.5%20billion%20in%20global%20funding">$91.5 billion in global funding</a> –
almost twice as much of funding raised in 2020.</p>
<p>While in the Middle East, the value of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1181233/middle-east-fintech-venture-capital-investment-value/">venture capital investments</a>
in fintech is expected to increase to approximately $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to $78 million in 2017.</p>
<p>But what are investors really looking for in their next fintech investment?</p>
<p>Here are some of the main things investors look for when evaluating a fintech project or startup:</p>
<p><strong>a. Products solving clear problems or customer pain points</strong></p>
<p>They say &#8220;necessity is the mother of invention&#8221;</p>
<p>It''s all about finding new approaches to solving a problem – improving a current legacy system, or introducing a whole
new product or service that makes our lives easier.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://monese.com/gb/en">Monese</a>, the first mobile current account in the UK, was built to serve migrants
who couldn''t open bank
accounts because they didn''t have physical home addresses.</p>
<p>Dubbed as the peace-of-mind money app, Monese is a digital banking alternative that allows anyone to open multi-currency
accounts via a mobile application.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, investors pay attention to fintech ideas that go beyond short-term solutions that address underlying
problems and meet the needs of our changing lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>b. Powerful Teams</strong></p>
<p>A great fintech idea is just as important as the team bringing that idea to life. The ability to access top talent is a
key growth driver in moving organizations forward. One of the key challenges found when building powerful fintech teams
is striking a balance between technical and business needs. Hiring, training, and retaining capable business teams is
crucial to be able to leverage the success of technical know-how and resources. Showing investors that you have built
solid systems that can strike that balance can put you in a more favorable position.</p>
<p><strong>c. Solution Scalability</strong></p>
<p>Navigating the challenges of scaling and growth is a challenge for all startups. To win the hearts of investors you must
demonstrate how you can scale your business – platform, teams, operations – to expand from a single segment, use case
and market to a multi-X. As a fintech startup, you need to understand that, when scaling, you can''t do everything
yourself. Knowing how to scale various facets of the business, including being able to partner to access the right
assets and capabilities to scale rapidly is important. Make sure you have a vision to share with investors regarding how
you will cross that bridge when you come to it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Integration</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, connecting platforms with banking and payment infrastructure required development teams to build
integrations for each financial institution involved – this is very costly, complex, and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Today, there is no need to reinvent the wheel – you can save valuable time to market and mitigate costs by using fintech
APIs as building blocks to avoid recreating functionality that already exists.</p>
<p>APIs are driving an explosion of new business models. Organizations looking to enter the fintech space need to learn to
leverage APIs to power innovation and new product/feature development.</p>
<p>Aligning business objectives with the right technology is imperative to any fintech product''s sustainable growth. If
your value proposition is the brain of the operation, APIs are the heart. Figure out early on what you will develop
in-house and whose technology you can utilize to help you grow.</p>

<p>The MENA region has seen a surge of fintech startups within the past few
years. <a href="https://www.bwmonline.com/2021/07/29/mena-fintech-outlook-2021-pandemic-ushers-in-new-growth/">In November 2020</a>,
the region had over 400 fintech ventures.</p>
<p>Fintech is disrupting many business verticals and entrepreneurs around the world are constantly introducing new ways to
bank through their Fintech startups.</p>
<p>But it is not all sunshine and rainbows. Entrepreneurs face several challenges and roadblocks when launching Fintech
startups.</p>
<p>In this article, we will tackle the three most common technical challenges faced by Fintech startups.</p>
<h4>What are the most common Fintech challenges faced by startups?</h4>
<p><strong>1. Cyber Security Risks</strong></p>
<p><em>With great power comes great responsibility.</em></p>
<p>Access to sensitive financial and personal information makes fighting off cybercriminals a daily responsibility for
Fintechs.</p>
<p>According to Verizon’s Data Breach
Report, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">9 in 10</a>
data breaches are financially driven. Therefore, robust security and privacy protocols are paramount for Fintech
products. Whether it’s biometric, two-factor, or risk-based authentication, Fintechs will need to invest in the best
tech-driven security measures to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Complex Regulations &amp; Compliance</strong></p>
<p>As pressure increases on Fintech startups to address existing or potential regulatory hurdles, this inevitably leads to
the slowdown of their speed to market.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a startup, it is crucial to be aware of the regulatory framework of the financial system in your region:
<em>Are there existing regulations governing your products/services? Do you comply with them? What licenses are required?
Should you partner with another company that has already acquired the license?</em></p>
<p>This is where <a href="/what-is-regtech">Regtech</a> comes into play. Regtech is an emerging industry enabling regulatory
compliance using technology to ease the burden on companies. Relying on the latest fintech technologies to address
regulatory schemes and compliance, Regtech companies act as a bridge between regulators and financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Human-Tech Balance</strong></p>
<p>As the use of AI and machine learning continues to increase, services are becoming more human-less.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of customers in the MENA region prefer to interact with a human when handling their finances.
This can leave many Fintech startups struggling to persuade customers in the region to abandon their traditional banks.</p>
<p>For Fintechs to overcome this &#8220;confidence gap&#8221;, a customer-centric financial model is paramount to be able to achieve
the human-tech balance. This can happen through keeping customers’ needs and experience at the heart of every new
technology adopted.</p>

<p>Embedding financial services within your core business offerings promises to unlock new revenue opportunities and reduce
operational costs.</p>
<p>As you explore the rising power of embedded finance and consider integrating financial mechanisms into your business,
the inevitable ‘build-or-buy'' dilemma will arise.</p>
<p>And here comes the million-dollar question: ‘Should we develop a solution of our own from scratch or rely on a third
party?''</p>
<p>Let''s figure it out!</p>
<h4>Before you decide to Build or Buy.</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is my willingness to invest in payment offerings compared to my core business?</li>
<li>Am I ready to build new teams for technology development (with payments experience), partner management, compliance,
and operations?</li>
<li>Where does my business operate? Where should I offer payments and other financial services today? Where do I plan to
expand in the future?</li>
<li>Will building my own payments solution give me better control over user experience, drive loyalty or reduce
operational costs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Read our blog post on <a href="/embedded-finance-strategy">Designing an embedded finance strategy that works for your business</a>
and explore various opportunities to get into the embedded finance game.</p>
<p>1.Build</p>
<p>If you prioritize control and customization or need to address specific business/market needs, building your own
solution may be the best option for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of building an embedded finance solution in-house</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Control &amp; Customization</li>
</ul>
<p>You have 100% control over the development process. Building your own embedded finance features or solutions means that
you are in charge of defining the scope of your innovation initiatives. With that control comes flexibility and freedom
to add the desired functionality and features to support your unique business needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Long Term Incremental Cost at Scale</li>
</ul>
<p>Features are developed in the order desired, with the flexibility to potentially change that order as business goals
shift. You can build your own solution with the functions that you need only, without the bloat of unwanted features.
This way, you can eliminate the costs of unnecessary features, recurring subscription fees, and other hidden costs that
add up in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of building an embedded finance solution in-house</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regulations &amp; Compliance Requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether it''s complying with never-ending financial regulations or undergoing multiple security and risk assessments,
building an embedded finance solution from scratch can be extremely bureaucratic and time-consuming. This also exposes
you to unnecessary risk in an industry that you are not familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to Market and Upfront Investment</li>
</ul>
<p>Acquiring qualified teams and managing product development cycles can be very expensive. Building software from scratch
requires significant investment in financial capital and time. In addition, at times the infrastructure setup itself can
be costly and require significant scale to justify the investment. It also takes your focus away from your core business
which can have various consequences short and long term.</p>
<p>2.Buy</p>
<p>If your challenges are well-defined, are commonly found in your industry, and can mostly be addressed by existing
solutions, then you should consider buying or white-labeling a ready-made solution.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of buying an embedded finance solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>Opting for a ready-made product or solution can be less of a financial burden than building your own from scratch. This
will allow you to save on the increasing costs of ongoing development, maintenance, and updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-to-Market</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready-made solutions can get up and running faster. Regulatory compliance, development, and testing are taken care of
allowing you to launch products and services at a much faster time to market. This allows you to test out your concepts
in a quick manner and iterate rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of buying an embedded finance solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recurring Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller businesses and organizations, off-the-shelf solutions often come with hefty monthly subscription fees.
Subscriptions tend to be priced per user and/or usage and therefore as businesses scale, consistent recurring fees can
become a major financial burden.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customization</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter how many features an off-the-shelf solution provides, they will not fully suit your specific requirements.
Poor product-market fit and the need to further implement workarounds or buy additional software can add up very
quickly.</p>
<h4>Tip by SimpliFi</h4>
<p>There are a lot of factors to consider such as <strong>control</strong>, <strong>monetary costs</strong>, <strong>time to market</strong>, <strong>customization</strong>,
and <strong>implementation</strong> to be able to choose the right path for your organization. <strong>So, build or buy?</strong> There is no one
size fits all answer to the question. Understanding your business goals and requirements is vital to making a choice.</p>

<p>For centuries, financial services have been the banking sector’s birthright. Complex systems, bureaucracy, and
compliance restrictions made it impossible for other organizations to take a piece of the (financial offering) pie.</p>
<p>Today, brands across all sectors are being empowered with financial infrastructure driven by powerful plug &amp; play APIs,
making it possible for any organization to provide the financial services that they need for their partners and
customers.</p>
<p>Consumers are increasingly demanding faster, simpler and more accessible means to manage and access their finances.
Thanks to the move towards unbundling of the financial services value chain, this is now becoming a reality.</p>
<p>We’ve rounded up the top 5 reasons why you need to start thinking about weaving in financial services into your business
too:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Revenue Stream</strong>
Diversify your revenue streams and open up new ones. Monetize the spending of your customers, partners, or vendors.
By adding financial services to your existing business model, you can avail new products and services and earn money
through interchange revenue (cards), float income, foreign exchange fee and a number of other sources – just like a
bank would!</li>
<li><strong>Scale Faster and Cheaper</strong>
No need to acquire regulatory licenses, build compliance functions, set up operations processes and team, obtain
certifications and build and integrate systems. Scale your products and services faster with minimal investment
across different markets without the need to become a payments expert.</li>
<li><strong>Elevated Customer Experiences</strong>
Customers no longer have to deal with multiple entities to fulfill their financial needs. By embedding financial
services in your user journeys and features, you can provide customers with simple and seamless purchasing journeys
and financial services that are highly contextualized and relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Equity</strong>
Offering highly relevant personal financial services and access to customer data can deepen your relationship with
your stakeholders and in turn boost brand equity. Businesses can use this data to retain customers and partners,
build trust and loyalty and essentially increase customer and partner lifetime value.</li>
<li><strong>Decreased Operational Spend</strong>
Managing your own financial services means massive savings over time. Save money on direct recurring expenses, such
as processing fees and foreign exchange commissions as well as indirect operational expenses from managing large
financial operations teams to handle settlement and reconciliation.</li>

<p>Many of the biggest organizations around the world are also seeking innovative ways to bring the ease and simplicity of
digitized payments into new verticals within their businesses.</p>
<p>By simply adding embedded finance into your business though is not enough, how can your organization reap the benefits
of embedded finance in a way that adds real business value?</p>
<p>In this article, we will help you navigate this complex ecosystem by designing an embedded finance strategy that works
for your business and understanding the various available opportunities for embedded finance.</p>
<h4>How to design an effective embedded finance strategy?</h4>
<p><strong>1. Identify your Embedded Finance needs</strong></p>
<p>As with any other strategic decision, you need to identify the goals of an Embedded Finance solution. Find out how to
leverage financial services in a way to better serve your customers, better retain them, and drive more margin. Here are
some questions that might help you decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it going to answer consumer needs/solve a problem they experience?</li>
<li>Are you launching an entirely new venture to fulfill a specific need?</li>
<li>Are you aiming to increase loyalty or add additional revenue streams to your business?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Understand the ecosystem and find your position</strong>
There are several methods to embed finance and banking programs into a non-financial business. To engage embedded
finance in a meaningful way, you need to decide on the role you want to play in this model.</p>
<h4>Opportunities for Embedded Finance</h4>
<p><strong>A. Embedded Payments</strong></p>
<p>The integration of a payment infrastructure to foster seamless payment processes within an app or platform is referred
to as Embedded Payments. Payments generally represent the basic financial service to be embedded into a non-financial
product experience. Embedded payments have evolved to essentially become a fundamental part of the value proposition of
any SaaS or E-commerce platform. Subscription-based payment for SaaS platforms, E-wallet integration in E-commerce
platforms, payroll automation software, and more are all examples of Embedded payments.</p>
<p><strong>B. Embedded Card Payments</strong></p>
<p>Embedded cards allow organizations to simplify the process of paying employees and contractors and digitize a number of
business payments. Companies can transfer funds electronically into their own branded cards without the need of issuing
a check or making direct deposits.</p>
<p>SimpliFi offers card issuing services in MENA and Pakistan. We offer multiple customized card programs – Corporate
Partner Payouts, Corporate Spend, Buy Now Pay Later, and Consumer Spend cards.</p>
<p><strong>C. Embedded Insurance</strong></p>
<p>The embedded insurance model represents the bundling of coverage or protection with the purchase of a product or
service. It entails abstracting insurance functionalities into technology enabling a third party to seamlessly integrate
innovative insurance solutions.</p>
<p>It is transforming the insurance distribution model. Embedded Finance companies provide transactional APIs which allow
insurance solutions to integrate with apps and websites.</p>
<p><strong>D. Embedded Investment</strong></p>
<p>Investing often seems complicated and out of reach, and this is exactly where Embedded investment comes into play. It
allows platforms to integrate stock market investing into their service offerings. They are professionally managed
portfolios made accessible through consumer apps. Portfolios are automatically adjusted based on the market and
accordingly, money is automatically transferred to user accounts.</p>

<p>Technological advancements are not new to the world of Finance. However, the surge in digital innovation and change in
modern-day consumer habits has given rise to new, innovative business models.</p>
<p>As consumers seek frictionless transactions and immediacy across all daily experiences, the financial services industry
is undergoing a paradigm shift redefining how these services are delivered.</p>
<p>Boundaries between banks, retailers, and customers are blurring day after day. Traditional businesses are embracing
financial services on a new level as they integrate financial capabilities into their core assets.</p>
<p>Companies of all types and sizes – large techs, telecoms, software, retailers, logistics companies, and more – have
started to invest in embedded finance.</p>
<p>Embedded finance is now the bridge between financial services and end consumers. From buy now, pay later models and
integrated insurance services to point-of-service lending and card issuance through card as a service platforms.</p>
<h4>What is Card-as-a-Service?</h4>
<p>Card-as-a-service or CaaS is a complete card issuing service for forward-thinking companies looking to launch, design,
and scale feature-rich payment cards for their customers, employees, and other business stakeholders.</p>
<p>The majority of CaaS solutions provide API-driven experiences that simplify the process of embedding financial services
directly into your own ecosystem – making it easy for businesses of all sizes to roll out a variety of card programs
quickly across the organization.</p>
<h4>How is it powering organization''s to &#8220;become financial services companies&#8221;?</h4>
<p>Embedding financial services into an organization''s business flows not only strengthens existing business offerings but
also unlocks opportunities to power new revenue streams, reduce operational costs and drive loyalty.</p>
<p>While many have taken steps in availing new forms of payments across their organizations, others have gone the extra
mile and have started issuing their own branded physical and virtual payment cards. This has allowed organizations to
acquire more control over financial operations.</p>
<p>The evolution of this infrastructure and approach can be leveraged to support businesses in scaling across multiple
markets with ease. Using one set of APIs, businesses can launch in several markets and streamline financial operations
across their organization with less dependence on various third-party financial services providers.</p>
<h4>Unlock new opportunities whilst solving business challenges</h4>
<p><strong>1. Gain control over your payments experience</strong></p>
<p>What was once handled by a traditional bank can now be placed under a single digital roof. Having more control over
payment processes and the banking journey, businesses can gain a better understanding of consumer payment habits and
preferences. As a result, organizations are able to control and personalize payment experiences to better tailor
business offerings to consumer needs whilst accessing more data on their customers and building a closer relationship
with them.</p>
<p><strong>2. Opening up new revenue streams</strong></p>
<p>Businesses can issue branded payment cards for their partners, vendors, &amp; customers to drive an additional revenue
stream. Businesses can also earn income on transaction costs, maintenance fees and even earn small percentages of
interest by offering lending services or buy now pay later schemes.</p>
<p><strong>3. Solving business problems</strong></p>
<p>Cards are a highly versatile payment tool which can be used in various settings to enable B2B payments. A lot of
business payments still involve dealing with cash and those that are using digital means find those methods to be
inefficient and hard to scale. Payment cards bring global acceptance and trust whilst managing risks through highly
customized controls thereby opening up possibilities to enable a variety of use cases.</p>
<h4>Where to start?</h4>
<p>Losing to more digital-ready competitors is not an option. Customers, employees, and business partners expect companies
to facilitate more efficient payment processes and ecosystems – but like anything in the business world, &#8220;no one size
fits all&#8221;.</p>
<p>To make your journey to embedded finance a more meaningful one, you must design a strategy that fits your unique
business needs. Here is where you need to start:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze your organization''s digital needs and decide on the tools to be embedded into your business processes.</li>
<li>Identify your goals for the Embedded Finance project. In order to pick the right solution, you must first understand
your business needs.</li>
<li>Understand the value chain and decide on your partnership strategy.</li>
<li>Work with a trusted service provider that focuses on the niche you are looking for to implement your embedded finance
needs.</li>
