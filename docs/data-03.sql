<p>The Riyadh-based and "Visa Direct Award 2022" winner NQOODLET joins forces with Dubai-based SimpliFi to bring to
market a modern and innovative expense management solution for SMEs in the region.</p>
<p>The partnership aims at providing a seamless card issuance experience for NQOODLET users which makes spending and
tracking of company expenses a fully automated process. NQOODLET will enable highly configurable virtual and physical
prepaid cards using SimpliFi’s modern card issuing APIs which powers card programs in ways that meet a wide range of
business needs.</p>
<p>The idea to launch NQOODLET originated from a market need since obtaining corporate cards by SMEs is difficult with
long lead times, in addition to the complexity of controlling and monitoring the spending limit on corporate cards,
potentially resulting in financial and legal issues as well as a struggle with budgeting, expense claims, and expense
reports.</p>
<p>The Founder &amp; CEO of NQOODLET, Mohammed Milyani, regards the partnership as "an example of how FinTech is maturing
into a diversity of solutions supporting the needs of both consumers and businesses". He adds, "the market is in
dire need of leading edge digital products that target gaps in our current FinTech offer. We’re jointly targeting a
gap where automation designed for SMEs has not yet gotten enough attention."</p>
<p>Ali Sattar, Founder &amp; CEO at SimpliFi, echoes the same sentiment. "The partnership brings together two innovative and
enterprising technology companies in the region to empower businesses to take control of their corporate expense
management using simple, automated solutions that streamline business operations and improve employee productivity."</p>

<p><em>New investors, Global Founders Capital and 4DX Ventures, are joined by existing investors, Raed Ventures and Rally Cap
Ventures</em></p>
<p>SimpliFi, a Cards as a Service (CaaS) platform for MENA and Pakistan, has raised $5.1 million in funding to accelerate
its expansion across the region following its beta launch in August 2021.</p>
<p>This round of funding saw participation from Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, 4DX Ventures and Rally Cap
Ventures. Both Raed Ventures and Rally Cap Ventures had participated in SimpliFi''s funding round earlier in the year
along with a number of strategic investors from the region and outside as well as current and former employees of
Careem, Facebook, Plaid and Remitly.</p>
<p>SimpliFi provides businesses a one stop solution to issue and manage their cards program. The company manages all
ecosystem partners required to issue cards including banks, card schemes, processors, identity verification, card
fulfillment and customer care to deliver a seamless experience across multiple markets. In addition to providing a
purpose built tech stack, SimpliFi manages day to day card operations and compliance functions so businesses can focus
on their core strengths whilst leveraging the capabilities and scale of SimpliFi.</p>
<p>After launching its beta version in August this year, the company received strong interest from organizations across the
region seeking to issue cards to fulfill their business needs and to offer card products to SMEs and consumers. The
company has inked several strategic partnerships with banks, processors and other providers to enable its CaaS platform
and signed up a number of clients, many of which are the largest brands and category leaders in the region. In parallel,
SimpliFi has been building the team aggressively with experience from Careem, Grab, Gojek, Uber, PayPal, Marqeta,
Mastercard, Facebook and Network International.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were overwhelmed (yet humbled) by the response we got after we launched in August. It was only then that we realized
that the opportunity was substantially bigger than what we had originally anticipated which emboldened us to double down
and accelerate our expansion across the region.&#8221; commented Ali Sattar, Founder and CEO of SimpliFi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like the card issuance space and have backed similar players (to SimpliFi) in other regions of the world. SimpliFi
has a world class team with strong regional network and experience, undying passion and uncompromising values and we are
confident that they are on their way to becoming the leading card issuance platform in the region.&#8221; commented Tito
Costa, Partner at Global Founders Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;SimpliFi''s vision to transform the payments infrastructure in the region to create sustainable impact and its ethos
towards honesty, excellence and continuous improvement are aligned with our mission and values. We are excited to be
partnering with Ali and the team as they build something truly unique and impactful.&#8221; says Peter Orth, Co-Founder and
General Partner at 4DX Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raed joined SimpliFi on its journey earlier in the year and we''ve been truly impressed by the speed of execution of the
team and their ability to attract top notch brands as clients. At the same time we see growing demand for card issuance
in the region and are excited to continue to back SimpliFi as it expands its presence across the region.&#8221; says Wael
Nafee, Partner at Raed Ventures.</p>

<p><em><strong>Identity verification technology enables SimpliFi customers to seamlessly issue virtual or physical payment cards in

<p><a href="https://www.veriff.com/">Veriff</a>, a global identity verification provider is partnering with <a href="/">SimpliFi</a>, a

<p><em><strong>Backing from Raed Ventures along with a number of regional and global investors puts SimpliFi in a strong position
for its commercial launch</strong></em></p>
<p>SimpliFi, a Cards as a Service (CaaS) platform for MENA and Pakistan, launches its card issuance platform today.
Comprised of a rich set of publicly available APIs and an easy to use portal, any business, be it a fintech, gig
platform, enterprise or SME, can issue cards instantly and manage their program end to end through SimpliFi.</p>
<p>SimpliFi provides businesses a one stop solution to issue and manage their cards program. The company manages all the
ecosystem partners required to issue cards including banks, card schemes, processors, identity verification and card
fulfillment to deliver a seamless experience across multiple markets. In addition to providing a purpose built tech
stack, SimpliFi handles day to day card operations and compliance functions so businesses can focus on their core
strengths whilst leveraging the capabilities and scale of SimpliFi.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Ali Sattar, previously head of CareemPay, the idea of SimpliFi was seeded when Ali was looking to
issue cards but he quickly realized the numerous complexities in setting up such a program. He found it challenging to
launch in one market let alone scaling it across multiple markets given the fragmented payments ecosystem in the region.
His frustration was echoed by a number of other entrepreneurs and business owners and it was only then that he realized
the enormity of the problem and the massive opportunity that lay ahead. The rest of the team comes with a wealth of
experience building and scaling technology businesses for Grab, Gojek, Uber, Careem, PayPal, Marqeta, Facebook and
Network International.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prepaid cards are highly versatile with a host of use cases allowing businesses to streamline operations, generate new
revenue streams and drive loyalty. Until now banks have had the exclusivity in issuing cards. We are changing that by
empowering every business to become a payments company and participating in the benefits from financial ownership,
without the underlying complexities and hassle. The massive impact this can create on the financial services ecosystem
in the region inspires us to wake up every day.&#8221; commented Sattar.</p>
<p>The company closed its seed round earlier in the year led by Raed Ventures which has also backed MENA heavyweights such
as Tabby and Lean. Rally Cap, a global venture collective focusing on early stage, emerging market fintech opportunities
and Sukna Ventures, an early stage regional VC, also participated along with a number of angels including Chris
Adelsbach, Idris Bello, Osama AlRaee, Abdullah Mohammed Al-Dosari and current and former executives at Facebook, Careem,
Plaid and Remitly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investing in SimpliFi was an easy decision given the problem it is solving, the vision and experience of the team and
the early traction they have had. We see card issuance being a common need and a major pain point for a number of
businesses we speak to and are excited to be supporting SimpliFi as they build the payments infrastructure to enable
companies in the region to build and scale.&#8221; says Wael Nafee, a member of the investment team at Raed Ventures.</p>
<p>Potential customers can now sign up on SimpliFi''s website for a demo account to access SimpliFi''s easy to use portal and
comprehensive card issuance and management APIs. Whilst SimpliFi''s APIs provide the tools necessary for developers to
test out and launch products with minimal coding, the portal is designed specifically for non-technology businesses so
finance and operations teams can get access to the same capabilities without any technology or payments background.</p>
