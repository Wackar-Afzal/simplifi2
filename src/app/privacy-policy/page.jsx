                When you use the Website, SimpliFi will collect and process information regarding you (as an individual) which allows you to be identified either by itself, or together with other information which has been collected. SimpliFi may also be able to collect and process information regarding other persons in this same manner, if you choose to provide it to SimpliFi.
              </p>
              <p>
                This information may be classified as "Personal Data", and can be collected by SimpliFi both when you choose to provide it (e.g., when you contact SimpliFi through our online contact forms) or simply by analysing your behaviour on the Website.

                  In any situation where you decide to share Personal Data related to other persons through the Website, you will be considered as an independent data controller regarding that Personal Data, and must assume all inherent legal obligations and responsibilities. This means, among other things, that you must fully indemnify SimpliFi against any complaints, claims or demands for compensation for damages which may arise from the processing of this Personal Data, brought by the third parties whose information you provide through the SimpliFi.
