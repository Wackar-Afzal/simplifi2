        "Based in Dubai, SimpliFi was founded by Ali Amin Sattar, a seasoned leader in payments, banking, and technology with over 25 years of industry experience. Having led large-scale financial ventures across the region, Ali saw how complex and fragmented it was for businesses in MENA and Pakistan to launch and manage card programs.",
        "SimpliFi was built to change that.",
        "What started as a simple idea in the UAE quickly evolved into a powerful Cards-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that expanded across the GCC helps businesses issue and manage physical and virtual cards—without the usual operational or regulatory hurdles. With a focus on speed, compliance, and scalability, SimpliFi gives companies the infrastructure to build and grow payment products on their own terms."
