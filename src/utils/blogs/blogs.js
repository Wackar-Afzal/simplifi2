        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/001-main.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Spending across virtually all markets and use cases is increasingly migrating to digital means with cards accounting\nfor the lion’s share of such payments. According to a recent study by McKinsey, card-based payments are expected to\ndrive ~53% of the payments in the GCC by 2026. Broadly, cards can be classified into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepaid Cards:</strong> The lightest and simplest form of cards. Funds need to be loaded on the cards in advance,\nand cards can then be used anywhere the card network is accepted.</li>\n<li><strong>Debit cards:</strong> These would most likely be linked to an existing bank account with an adjoining overdraft facility.</li>\n<li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> These are used as credit instruments, and a credit check is required before these can be issued.\nThese debt instruments generally have an interest component and other late payment fees attached to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The card ecosystem consists of a <code>four-party model</code>. It's the industry's accepted framework for processing card payments\nbetween buyers and sellers. These four parties are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cardholder:</strong> The buyer who generally owns the funds and uses the card</li>\n<li><strong>Issuing bank:</strong> The bank which is the issuer of the card to the cardholder</li>\n<li><strong>Acquiring bank:</strong> The bank which owns the relationship with the merchant (the seller)</li>\n<li><strong>Merchants:</strong> The party who is selling the item to the buyer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/\">SimpliFi</a> is an enabler that empowers any business to issue its own branded cards. The business can\ncustom build its card product with its own set of features which can be used to offer differentiated propositions to\nits customers or to solve payment-related pain points in its ecosystem (e.g. suppliers payments, payouts to its\nemployees or partners, etc). For a business to issue its own branded, customized cards, there are multiple aspects\nthat need to be taken care of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Issuer Bank:</strong> Issuer banks would be responsible for providing custody accounts, settling payments with the card\nschemes and fulfilling regulatory compliance requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Processors:</strong> These are technology platforms that provide tools for businesses to issue and manage their card programs</li>\n<li><strong>Schemes:</strong> These are card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Mada, etc.) that provide a BIN (essentially a\nnumbering series) on which the cards are issued. The scheme’s logo appears on the card which identifies the network\nthat it belongs to</li>\n<li><strong>Card manufacturers:</strong> These are certified players who would be able to print physical cards based on the design\nprovided by businesses and approved by issuing banks and schemes</li>\n<li><strong>Card tokenization:</strong> There are wallet providers (e.g. ApplePay, GooglePay etc) which enable virtual cards to be\nprovisioned through the phone so that transactions can be made on POS terminals in a contactless manner to pay by\ncard as well as online payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Data enrichment:</strong> Relatively newer to the cards business, these companies help enrich transaction data by\ncleaning up and enhancing data coming through the works and adding additional valuable information i.e., merchant\nlogo, merchant location, spend categorization etc.</li>\n<li><strong>KYC service providers:</strong> Depending upon the nature of the card program, KYC (verifying cardholder identity) may\nbe needed during card issuance or delivery of the cards which is enabled by such providers.</li>\n<li><strong>Courier companies:</strong> Ensure delivery of cards to the relevant card holders and, in some cases perform verification\nat the time of delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> We all would have called our banks for some aspects related to our cards. When businesses\nissue their own branded cards, they need to also ensure that they provide the necessary customer care channels\nfor cardholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, card issuance has multiple technology, compliance, and operations components, and a lot of effort goes into\nbringing these components together and ensuring these run seamlessly. Therefore, setting up and running a card program\nrequires substantial time and capital investment which is where modern card issuance platforms like\n<a href=\"/\">SimpliFi</a> can help realize massive savings in time and money for businesses looking to launch their\nbespoke card programs.</p>\n<p>While launching a card program comes with obvious benefits of driving new revenue streams, streamlining business\noperations, getting deep insights into cardholder spend behavior, and building loyalty with the target segment (e.g.,\ncustomers, partners, merchants etc.) it is pertinent to understand the economics associated with running bespoke\ncard programs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technology costs:</strong> Building and running a technology stack (e.g., operations portal, app, etc.), hosting an\naddressing local regulations and certifications like PCI DSS.</li>\n<li><strong>Processor costs:</strong> Processing costs associated with issuing and maintaining cards, transaction processing,\nand tokenization.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance costs:</strong> KYB/KYC costs to onboard businesses and cardholders and for ongoing screening to fulfill\ncompliance requirements and manage risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Interchange and scheme fee:</strong> Transaction costs and revenue share taken by issuing banks and schemes for\neach transaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost of capital:</strong> Where funds are required to be loaded on the cards in advance (e.g. prepaid cards) there\nare implicit costs around funds being locked onto the cards. Technologies like Just-in-time funding which are\nmade available on the SimpliFi platform, have solved this problem by ensuring that cards are loaded in real-time\nduring the time of transactions, thereby ensuring that funds are not blocked on the cards.</li>\n<li><strong>Fraud Monitoring:</strong> Margins on payment products are thin, which means that fraud can very quickly eat into those\nmargins if not kept in check, thereby necessitating cutting-edge fraud management tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Card production &amp; delivery:</strong> If physical cards are required the cost of production and delivery of cards can add\nup quickly, especially if a certain percentage of cardholders are not active or generating sufficient\ntransaction activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer care:</strong> Providing customer care, especially 24×7 bi-lingual costs can be expensive especially in\nthe initial stages when the card program is scaling up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/\">SimpliFi</a> has invested a great deal of time and effort in building a modern card issuance platform\nalong with operations and compliance capabilities with all the partnerships in place for you to launch your card\nprogram with ease.

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/002-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Compliance refers to the adherence to a set of regulations and industry standards designed to protect consumers and\nensure the security of financial transactions in addition to protecting organizations from all types of risks. This\nincludes compliance with laws such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Data Protection and\nPrivacy Regulations, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations.</p>\n<p>Adhering to regulations and best practices for preventing fraud, suspicious transactions and safeguarding sensitive\ninformation is crucial for financial institutions to maintain a good reputation, avoid heavy fines and ensure they\ndon’t become a target by criminals. It is important for companies to stay up-to-date with the latest compliance\nrequirements, and to have robust processes in place to ensure they are meeting them.</p>\n<p>Global compliance is the process of a business following all laws, standards, and regulations that apply to them\nacross the globe. Managing compliance for different jurisdictions can be a challenging task for businesses and\norganizations operating in multiple countries. This is particularly true for industries that are heavily regulated,\nsuch as financial services and information technology. In order to maintain compliance, organizations must be aware\nof and adhere to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which they operate.</p>\n<h4>The challenge of compliance</h4>\n<p>Information security is one area in which compliance can be particularly challenging. Different jurisdictions have\ndifferent laws and regulations regarding data protection and privacy, and organizations must ensure that they are in\ncompliance with all of them. This can include implementing security measures such as encryption and regular security\naudits, as well as ensuring that employees are trained on proper data handling practices.</p>\n<p>Another area of compliance that can be challenging is money laundering and terrorist financing. Organizations must\nimplement procedures to detect and prevent these activities, as well as comply with reporting requirements. This can\ninclude undertaking regular risk assessments, conducting proper due diligence on corporate clients as well as\nindividuals, and training employees on how to identify and report suspicious activity.</p>\n<p>To manage compliance for different jurisdictions, organizations should have a clear understanding of the laws and\nregulations in each country in which they operate. They should also have a robust compliance framework in place,\nincluding regular training and monitoring to ensure that employees are aware of and adhere to the requirements.\nRegulations across multiple jurisdictions have a lot in common, however, some details are different. Neglecting or\noverlooking details can lead to non-compliance and potential legal consequences.</p>\n<p>In summary, managing compliance for multiple jurisdictions can be challenging, organizations face significant\ncompliance challenges when it comes to data privacy, information security, money laundering, and the financing of\nterrorism, particularly when operating in different countries. They should have a robust compliance program in place,\nincluding regular training and monitoring, to ensure they are compliant. Organizations should have a clear\nunderstanding of the laws and regulations in each country in which they operate.</p>\n<p>SimpliFi, the leading Cards as a Service (CaaS) platform for MENA and Pakistan has a robust and strong compliance\nframework in place to ensure compliance with laws and regulations across all the countries in which we operate.</p>\n<p>We have a dedicated team of experts who stay up-to-date on the latest laws and regulations, as we have implemented a\nvariety of tools and processes to ensure compliance at all times.

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/003-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>A Virtual Card</strong> is a payment card that exists solely in electronic form. It consists of a unique, randomly-\ngenerated 16-digit number and contains the exact card details as their physical counterparts: expiration date and\nCVV code. A virtual card mimics the function of a physical card to be used anywhere credit/debit cards are accepted.</p>\n<h4>How Do Virtual Cards Work?</h4>\n<p>Although commonly associated with online payments, virtual cards can be used to pay for any purchase – online or\noffline. When using a virtual card to pay your suppliers, customers, or workers, cards can be used the same way\nphysical cards are used at a point-of-sale terminal or entered online.</p>\n<h4>Virtual cards can be either disposable (one-time use) or multiple-use.</h4>\n<p>Virtual credit or debit cards can be restricted to a single-use – which is referred to as disposable virtual cards.\nIn some cases, virtual card numbers are generated for specific purchases with predefined amounts and frequency of use.\nOnce generated, cards can be revoked as soon as a transaction is complete.</p>\n<p>For B2B payments, you can set up a virtual card for every vendor or supplier. A virtual card number can be assigned\nexclusively to one supplier and turned off once a purchase is complete.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, multiple-use cards are assigned with an expiration date and can be reused until the date is\nreached. Multiple-use cards can be used for subscription services or any other type of recurring payment.</p>\n<h4>Combating Fraud With Virtual Cards – Using Modern Card Issuing</h4>\n<p>With more companies, like yours, moving their services into the digital realm, fraudsters are figuring out new ways\nto take advantage of the world of digital payments. No matter what business or industry you’re in, it’s time to give\npayment security some serious thought with cyber fraud on the rise.</p>\n<p>Virtual cards offer an ideal way to keep your business accounts secure and cybercriminals out of your wallet. These\ncards are becoming increasingly common among consumers, and businesses are now catching up.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>In 2025, the volume of virtual card transactions will rise to $5 trillion from $1.6 trillion in 2020</strong> – Juniper Research</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Virtual cards enable secure online transactions by allowing you to take preemptive measures to combat fraud. Card\nprograms created through modern card issuing providers like SimpliFi provide fine-grained controls on when, where,\nand how payments can be made.</p>\n<p>Just like any card program created on a modern card issuing platform, spend controls can restrict the use of virtual\ncards. Cards can be created for a one-time payment for a specific amount, time, place, or merchant category where the\ncard is accepted. These controls are verified as transactions take place to prevent attempts of card misuse.</p>\n<p><em>SimpliFi's modern card issuing APIs can help you design virtual card programs in ways that meet your\nspecific business needs.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore how SimpliFi can enable virtual card programs for your different business use cases.</em></p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/004-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>KYC is one of the most important terms in Fintech, and the financial ecosystem at large.\nWhat is KYC, you ask?\nIn this blog post, we explore what KYC is all about and what fintech owners need to know.</p>\n<h4>What is KYC, really?</h4>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>In Short</strong></p>\n<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a set of standards used by fintechs, banks, and other financial institutions to verify a\ncustomer’s legal identity.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Let’s explain more…</strong></p>\n<h4>The Essence of KYC</h4>\n<p>&#8220;Prevention is better than cure&#8221;, they say.</p>\n<p>KYC lies at the heart of fraud prevention. The main goal revolves around fraud prevention and constraining the ability\nof some users who fail to meet the given acceptance criteria.</p>\n<p>KYC verification procedures allow financial service providers to avoid working with customers involved in\n<a href=\"https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism\">money laundering</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism\">terrorist financing</a>,\nor other illicit financial activities.</p>\n<p>Serving as a line of defense against fraudulent activities, KYC procedures are often done at the time of customer\nonboarding – where identity documents are validated before customer approval. In other words, KYC is required any time a\nfintech accepts a new customer. An identity check will be executed and in some cases, additional customer key personal\ndata and documents will be requested by the financial service provider.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>KYC measurements can be further broken down into three levels: SDD, CDD, and EDD.</p>\n<p>Each client is evaluated for possible participation in financial crimes and assigned a certain rating – referred to as\n‘Risk Rating’.</p>\n<h4>KYC Risk Rating</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SDD – Standard Due Diligence (Low Risk)<br>This is the lowest level of verification and a faster due diligence process that identifies low-risk clients. When\nthere is little chance of money laundering or terrorist financing, SDD is used.</li>\n<li>CDD – Customer Due Diligence (Medium Risk)<br>Customer Due Diligence is a basic analysis of the client and is the most common form of KYC. It is a medium-risk\nsphere within fintech that focuses on risk assessment and understanding the customer’s transaction habits.</li>\n<li>EDD – Enhanced Due Diligence (High Risk)<br>Enhanced Due Diligence, or EDD, is very common with Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), or customers who are more\nlikely to participate in financial crimes – due to the nature of their business/operations. EDD will require fintech\nfirms to collect additional data for high-risk customers’ identity and business operations – data on wealth sources,\npress coverage of the customer, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these processes is followed by continuous monitoring and transaction documentation – especially in high-security\ncases.</p>\n<p>Without these procedures in place, overseeing financial bodies would have a hard time tracking illicit activities and\nstopping them.</p>\n<h4>What are the challenges that you might face in the KYC process?</h4>\n<p>Given the prevalence of cybercrime and its ever-changing practices, staying in compliance with KYC requirements can be\nchallenging for a fintech startup.</p>\n<p>KYC is an ongoing process. A fintech is required to regularly reassess its clients’ risk levels. To protect your fintech\nbusiness from regulatory sanctions, fraud attacks, and chargebacks, it is crucial to implement a KYC risk assessment for\nall your customers.</p>\n<p>Between due diligence, risk management, and continual analysis of transactions, fintechs spend a lot on KYC compliance\nannually.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><em>Global spend on financial crime compliance – including KYC and transaction monitoring – at financial institutions\nreached <a href=\"https://risk.lexisnexis.com/global/en/about-us/press-room/press-release/20210609-tcoc-global-study\">$213.9 Billion</a>\nin 2021.</em></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Unfortunately, these budgetary restraints aren’t uniform across the board.</p>\n<p>Therefore, fintech startups are likely to struggle – especially if new to the market or fundraising.</p>\n<p>Modern RegTech solutions help financial firms improve compliance performance by solving regulatory issues quickly, and\nat scale.

They’re the most popular – and for a long time the ‘only’ – issuers\nof cards in the world.</p>\n<p>But fast forward to today, banks are now seen as these big entities with stringent requirements, lots of legal\nprocesses, and in many cases not flexible or scalable enough to support some modern-day business use cases.</p>\n<p>Even more so, banks can’t offer the flexibility that innovative companies, like Uber, Talabat, and others, need when it\ncomes to payments today.</p>\n<p>As a result, companies like SimpliFi had to come up with ways to help companies scale payments by enabling issuing cards\nfaster and providing more controls.</p>\n<p>That’s what modern card issuing is all about.</p>\n<p>By providing the necessary infrastructure, platforms like SimpliFi, help organizations to build highly configurable\npayment cards to facilitate and enable innovative payment experiences.</p>\n<p>In addition, modern card issuers like SimpliFi, help businesses manage card programs in ways that legacy systems can’t –\nand probably never will.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you want to know how to issue a virtual card or physical card without having to go through bank\nhassles and approvals, then keep reading.</p>\n<h4>How to launch a winning payment card program</h4>\n<p>Having a successful payment card program for your business means your employees can enjoy flexible payment solutions\nthat make their jobs easier, faster, and more efficient.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you can also offer your customers card options, whether as your main solution or as an addition to\nyour overall service.</p>\n<p>With modern card issuance, the ideas and opportunities are endless.</p>\n<p>Here are 9 things you need to do to create, design, and launch a successful payment card program in your company.</p>\n<p>The tips included here cover launching a card both to support your employees and internal systems and to provide\nadditional benefits to your customers.</p>\n<h4>1. Determine your business goals</h4>\n<p>The first step in making any business decision is to identify your business needs and how you plan to acquire customers.\nDoing so will help you determine which platform and payment card solution works for you best.</p>\n<p>By identifying your goals, you’ll also be able to – at least initially – determine the metrics needed to measure the\nsuccess of your card issuing program.</p>\n<h4>2. Identify your target audience and their behavior</h4>\n<p>One of the most important steps is identifying who the target audience for your card issuance program is.</p>\n<p>Is it your employees? Your customers? Both?</p>\n<p>If it’s the latter, then it’s best to divide your card program into two layers or segments. You may even divide your\nlarger segments into sub-segments and note down usage policies and specifications for each. When it comes to customers,\ncreate a customer profile with demographics and behaviors such as when they make purchases, where they make them, along\nwith the type of businesses they frequent.</p>\n<h4>3. Identify pain points</h4>\n<p>The next step is designing your payment card solution to identify the pain points in your business and your customers’\nor employees’ pain points.</p>\n<p>Doing so means you’ll be able to clearly work on your card solution so that you can clear away bottlenecks and ensure a\nsmooth process later on.</p>\n<p>In this section, make sure you write everything down. From pressing problems all the way to minor issues.</p>\n<p>Is there something that may hinder your growth in the future? Is there something your competitors are doing that you\naren’t and that’s affecting your business?</p>\n<p>Write it all down.</p>\n<h4>4. Identify your geographies and audiences</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve identified your needs and pain points, it’s time to determine which geographical locations your employees or\ncustomers can use your cards in.</p>\n<p>You can also set up markets or industries where your cards can be used, spending limits, and other related policies.</p>\n<p>Planning your geographies should also include where your target audience is and where you’d like to expand – as a\nbusiness and service – in the future.</p>\n<h4>5. Specify the services your cards can perform</h4>\n<p>Now it’s time to focus on what your card can do and how and where they help customers. This section can focus on\nspecific industries, include ideas, or simply show how customers benefit from your card program.</p>\n<h4>6. Is your card program part of your business model?</h4>\n<p>You should definitely consider if your card is part of a larger service or service of its own. Is it part of your\nbusiness model? And if yes, how much does your card program contribute to your revenues?</p>\n<p>This will include both estimates and actual figures that you’ll need to review on a monthly, quarterly, and annual\nbasis.</p>\n<p>If the card is the core of your business model, or an essential part of it – then you shouldn’t focus on contributions\nbut instead compare and review how much your card program is in-line with your objectives and overall revenues.</p>\n<h4>7. Ensure your policies are working well</h4>\n<p>It’s unlikely you’ll get everything right the first time. So, once you launch your card, you’ll need a couple of weeks\nof trial-and-error to help you fine-tune your policies.</p>\n<p>Use the dashboard offered by your modern card issuing provider to track spending and money movements, uncover where\ncustomers and employees are falling short or not completing their tasks. Then fine-tune your card program accordingly.</p>\n<h4>8. Train employees and customers to use your card</h4>\n<p>When creating a payment card program, you should always have an onboarding process. Better yet, a quick onboarding video\nwill save you valuable time and will be available for customers and employees to see whenever they want to.</p>\n<p>Based on the initial trial, you can refine your onboarding process for how different people can use your payment card.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most important steps when launching a payment card program. Failing to onboard customers and/or\nemployees can result in many negative experiences and results.</p>\n<p>For employees, failure to correctly onboard them means more time spent by employees, wasted spend, longer processes,\nlots of frustration, and more.</p>\n<p>For customers, a negative experience can translate into bad reviews and less business.</p>\n<h4>9. Find the right partner to team up with</h4>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, it’s time to find the right modern card issuing program provider that will meet your\nrequirements and act as a supportive partner to your business.</p>\n<h4>Launching your Card Offering</h4>\n<p>Launching a payment card offering on your own is neither simple nor straight forward. For starters, there are a host of\nregulatory approvals and industry requirements a business has to go through.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are enablers, like SimpliFi, a payment card enabler that helps companies issue cards easily, while taking\ncare of the regulatory headache and requirements.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/008-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Tokenization has become a major buzzword these days and is often mentioned in the same breath as data security,\nblockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs.</p>\n<p>In payments, tokens play an integral role in adding an extra level of security to sensitive payment card data.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will answer your question ‘What is payment tokenization?’, and take a closer look at the concept of\ntokenization in the payments ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, let’s dive right in.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>What is Tokenization in simple terms?</h4>\n<p>In the simplest terms, tokenization is the process of securing sensitive data by exchanging it for a non-sensitive\nequivalent.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When applied to data security, tokenization is the act of substituting sensitive data with surrogate values – called\ntokens – that have no exploitable meaning or value.</p>\n<p>These tokens are the reference, or identifiers, that map back to the original, sensitive data.</p>\n<h4>What is Payment Tokenization?</h4>\n<p>In the payments industry, tokenization is used to safeguard a card’s PAN\n(<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primary-account-number-pan.asp\">Primary Account Number</a>) by exchanging it with\nmore secure data.</p>\n<p>The key strength of tokenization as a security measure, lies in the fact that card PAN numbers are not transmitted\nduring transactions. When tokenized cards are used for payments, actual card details are held safe in a secure digital\nvault, and tokens are used instead of exposing sensitive data.</p>\n<p>If a fraudster tries to intercept a transaction, all they will find is useless tokens, not any real card information.</p>\n<h4>Types of Tokenization</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security tokenization<br>Traditionally, security tokenization – also referred to as non-payment or acquirer tokenization – has been used to\nprotect cardholder data and personally identifiable information (PII).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When payment transactions are complete, security tokens are designed to protect sensitive information when ‘at rest’\nwithin a merchant’s database. This involves acquirer processors tokenizing cards using specific token formats, helping\nmerchants protect sensitive data and meet PCI requirements. Credentials can be stored for future, recurring payments,\nand seamless checkout experiences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network tokenization<br>Network tokenization is a type of payment card tokenization offered by the payments network—Visa, Mastercard,\nDiscover, American Express, etc.—that replaces primary account numbers (PANs) and other card details with a token\nissued by the card brand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When implemented properly, network tokenization ensures secure remote commerce throughout the payments ecosystem by\nremoving the need for merchants or third-party providers (Known as Token requestors i.e. ApplePay, GooglePay,,etc.) to\nexpose themselves to the risk of handling the raw PAN and other sensitive cardholder data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/\">SimpliFi</a> helps its clients launch tokenized card products which can be provisioned on ApplePay,\nGooglePay, etc. with minimal overhead work required by its clients.</p>\n<h4>What Does a Token Look Like?</h4>\n<p>Token formats are categorized as: Format preserving or non-format preserving.</p>\n<p><em>Format-preserving tokens</em> maintain the look and feel of original card data.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, non-format preserving tokens do not resemble the data in original cards and might also include\nalphanumeric characters.</p>\n<p><em>To illustrate:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Format Preserving</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example:</em></p>\n<p><strong>Original Card Number</strong></p>\n<p>1222 1111 1111 2222</p>\n<p><strong><em>Format Preserving Token</em></strong></p>\n<p>1222 7546 3498 2222</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-format Preserving</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>For example:</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Original Card Number</em></strong></p>\n<p>1222 1111 1111 2222</p>\n<p><strong><em>Non-format Preserving Token</em></strong></p>\n<p>2e5ghfjf-te635yr-7637eb-u9jy76</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Tokenization AND PCI Compliance</h4>\n<p>According to the PCI DSS, &#8220;Tokenization solutions do not eliminate the need to maintain and validate PCI DSS compliance,\nbut they may simplify a merchant’s validation efforts by reducing the number of system components for which PCI DSS\nrequirements apply&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In this case, tokenization can be considered as a best practice to reduce PCI compliance scope – thus reducing the costs\ninvolved with meeting and monitoring PCI requirements.</p>\n<p>It is simply one ingredient of an entire data security program that could qualify an organization for a PCI compliance\ncertification.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/009-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In any given payment card transaction there are multiple entities involved in the processing of those transactions- one\nof the fundamental entities found in the process is the <strong><em>Card Scheme</em></strong>.</p>\n<h4>What is a Card Scheme?</h4>\n<p>A card scheme is a payment network that processes payments made on prepaid, credit, and debit cards. Its primary role is\nto connect payors with payees by acting as a trusted party and managing payment transactions, including authorization,\nclearing, and settlement. Transactions are managed according to a set of procedures, rules, and arrangements that allow\ncardholders to buy products and services from retailers and other service providers.</p>\n<p>Card schemes serve as a fundamental part of payment processes, making online and offline purchases possible without the\nneed for cash or cheques.</p>\n<p>As consumers, we use these schemes day in and day out in spite of the fact that there is no direct relationship between\nthe card scheme and us – the consumer. Banks and other financial institutions are members of card schemes like Visa or\nMastercard which allows them to issue payment cards.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/009-01.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h4>How Does a Card Scheme Work?</h4>\n<p>Card schemes use a set of unique rules and procedures to transfer transaction information from the acquiring bank to the\nissuing bank.</p>\n<p>Once a payment card is tapped, swiped, or inserted in a POS terminal, or through an online payment system, a certain\npathway of communication opens up. This pathway is between the card scheme, the issuing bank, and the acquiring bank –\nrepresenting how cardholder data is stored, processed, and transmitted in order for a transaction to go through.</p>\n<p>As consumers tap their cards to pay, card schemes send authorization requests to cardholder’s bank – validating card\ndetails provided and ensuring sufficient funds are available in cardholder’s account. Once authorized, card schemes send\ninformation back to the acquiring bank. Transactions are settled typically overnight and funds are released and placed\ninto the merchant’s account.</p>\n<p>In short, card schemes are an essential component of successful transactions, connecting merchants and financial\ninstitutions to authorize transactions and facilitate the transfer of funds.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/010-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For decades, legacy payment infrastructure has enabled the payment of goods and services globally, reliably and\nsecurely. However, with the rise of new and complex business models, a one-size-fits-all architecture can no longer\nserve the demands of today's sophisticated use cases.</p>\n<p>That's why innovators are turning to modern card issuing solutions to provide payment experiences that ensure the\nsuccess and growth of these emerging business models.</p>\n<h4>What is Modern Card Issuing?</h4>\n<p>Modern card issuing is a more flexible and secure way to issue payment cards. Usually delivered through open APIs,\nmodern card issuing solutions empower businesses to customize, build and run card programs at scale.</p>\n<p>These solutions enable flexible embedded payment experiences that have been difficult to provide with legacy frameworks\nand architectures. Modern card issuing removes the roadblocks for businesses looking to deliver unique business models\nand payment experiences in a scalable, flexible and secure manner whilst ensuring quick time to market with limited\ninvestment.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Modern Card Issuing Use Cases for Merchants &amp; Retailers</h4>\n<p>Using card-issuing APIs, businesses can create customizable, branded, physical and virtual cards to serve multiple\nscenarios and use cases.</p>\n<p>Here are 4 modern card issuing use cases that merchants and retailers can leverage to scale their payments:</p>\n<h4>Use case 1: BNPL &amp; Virtual Cards</h4>\n<p>Buy now, pay later has become one of the most in-demand financing options around the world, sweeping the consumer\nlandscape. Today, customers can buy now and pay later for just about anything and everything. As the name suggests, this\nkind of financing provides customers with point-of-sale installment loans to purchase items and pay for them in small\ninstallments – breaking up the cost over predefined time periods.</p>\n<p>Modern card issuing is an easy way for BNPL platforms to provide their customers with BNPL payment options through\ninstantly issued virtual cards. To illustrate, when a customer initiates a BNPL purchase at a merchant's store or\nonline, a card is issued to pay the merchant instantly and is accepted through a standard POS system. This creates a\nseamless onboarding experience for the merchant since complex POS integration is not required beforehand and the BNPL\nplatform can scale on the back of the payment acceptance networks.</p>\n<h4>Use Case 2: Consumer Spend Cards</h4>\n<p>More businesses across various industries are implementing payments as a core part of their business model to stay at\nthe heart of their customers' financial lives.</p>\n<p>Modern card issuing APIs can provide merchants such as retail marketplaces with increased visibility into customer\nspending patterns and lifestyles to gain in-depth actionable insights. By collecting more data on how, when, and where\ncustomers are spending their money, merchants can provide more relevant, tailored offerings to enrich customer\nexperiences.</p>\n<h4>Use Case 3: Corporate Payout Cards</h4>\n<p>Merchants can conveniently pay employees, workers, contractors, and suppliers by pushing funds to cards that they issue.\nModern card issuing provides an alternative method for payroll, enabling organizations to pay salaries on reloadable\nprepaid cards. This helps today's B2B organizations adapt to emerging trends like remote workforces, gig economies, and\nsupply chain diversification.</p>\n<p>It's not just that. When it comes to merchant-supplier disbursements, modern card issuing facilitates supplier payments\nand breaks down the amount of complexity in a typical B2B payment process. Online and offline merchants and retailers\ncan quickly onboard suppliers and provide them with instant access to their money through prepaid cards.</p>\n<h4>Use case 4: Corporate spend cards</h4>\n<p>Corporate expenses and reimbursements can be painfully troublesome for both employers and employees alike.</p>\n<p>The challenge lies in how employees can receive the money and transact, and the ability of employers to place controls\nto align employee spending to corporate policy. Modern card issuing resolves both issues.</p>\n<p>Dynamic spend controls for virtual and physical cards can monitor spend and approve transactions in real-time. These\ncontrols can be set to restrict spending options to specific channels, and/or different user groups or individuals, or\nby different amounts for different merchant category codes.</p>\n<p>Across numerous industries, merchants and retailers can now create next-generation payment experiences that set them\napart.

The Middle East online food delivery market is heating\nup as well in response to soaring customer demand.</p>\n<p>On-demand delivery concepts and food disruptors have been emerging in the Middle East integrating online platforms with\noffline stores.</p>\n<p><strong>The overall on-demand food delivery market in the Middle East has\n<a href=\"https://blog.measurable.ai/2021/05/11/the-rise-of-food-delivery-market-in-the-middle-east/\">doubled</a> in revenue in\n2020, with Saudi Arabia having the highest revenue growth rate.</strong> Global players, like Deliveroo, and homegrown players\nincluding Talabat and Mrsool, are all striving to stay relevant in an ultra-competitive market.</p>\n<p>As the industry continues to develop, payments innovation and operational efficiency will become key factors for\nlong-term success for the various players in the region.</p>\n<p>In search of operational efficiency, innovative companies are starting to overhaul their existing payment\ninfrastructure, replacing inflexible systems with modern card issuing platforms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>What are Modern card issuing platforms?</h4>\n<p>Modern card issuing platforms are end-to-end platforms that enable organizations to create, distribute, and manage\nphysical and/or virtual cards using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_API\">open APIs</a>.</p>\n<p>But how can this power the on-demand food delivery market?</p>\n<p>Let's dive right in.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>The working principle of on-demand food delivery platforms is solely based on a network of several parties including the\ncustomer, the merchant, the aggregator, and the delivery partner.</em> Essentially, all these parties need to be constantly\nincentivized and empowered to sustain operations on the same platform.</p>\n<p>On-demand food delivery companies can partner with modern card issuing providers to give better experiences to their\ncustomers, streamline operations and drive profitability.</p>\n<p>Modern card issuing enables on-demand delivery companies to overcome long-standing payment challenges by maximizing\ncontrol over daily operations and driver-related payments.</p>\n<p>Today, food delivery companies have a golden opportunity to unlock use cases that have never been served before.</p>\n<p>With the help of open APIs, companies can issue their own cards to delivery couriers that can be used to process\npayments just like any other point-of-sale transaction. This way, delivery companies can scale with an ever-expanding\nrestaurant selection without payment settlement becoming a bottleneck – enabling delivery drivers to rely on modern card\npayment technology to pick up and pay for food for hungry customers on tight schedules.</p>\n<h4>How Modern Card Issuance addresses common payment pain points in on-demand food delivery</h4>\n<p>Many food delivery orders require point-of-sale payments. This means that food pickup payments are settled either\ndirectly between the platform and merchants or drivers have to pay for the order using their own payment methods when\npicking it up at the store.</p>\n<p>For settlement between the platform and restaurant, platforms have to build extensive financial operations teams to\nreconcile and process payments which means restaurants don't get paid for days or weeks.</p>\n<p>And if the driver has to pay out of his pocket then that is constrained by the cash that he carries on him which in turn\ndepends on how quickly he gets reimbursed for those orders. What if the driver after accepting an order didn't have\nenough cash to fulfill the order? Well, this might result in an unfulfilled order, a disappointed customer, and\nconsequently, missing out on a sale. And a lost sale means losing a customer as well, whether their order was small or\nlarge.</p>\n<p>Cards are essential to enable delivery drivers to always be in the money and fulfill orders when they don't have cash in\ntheir pockets.</p>\n<p><em>But how does modern card issuance differ from traditional card issuing?</em></p>\n<p>Older legacy card issuing methods are too complex and require lengthy and costly processes – slowing the onboarding of\nnew drivers. This, as a result, will prevent companies in this ecosystem from meeting the surge in demand for on-demand\ndelivery services.</p>\n<p>Mrsool's order revenue in 2020 is <a href=\"https://blog.measurable.ai/2021/05/11/the-rise-of-food-delivery-market-in-the-middle-east/\">more than five times that of 2019</a>,\nrising from 59% in Q3 of 2019 to 77% in Q1 2021.</p>\n<p>To meet the crush of orders, many on-demand delivery companies are scrambling and working 24/7 to hire thousands of\ndelivery couriers and operations associates.</p>\n<p>Modern card issuing is enabling on-demand delivery companies to thrive in a crowded market with fierce competition.</p>\n<p>Using modern card issuing platforms and their open APIs, cards can make it into the hands of drivers in short time\nframes. The faster these cards are in the hands of new drivers, the faster they can begin fulfilling orders. Once\ndrivers pass a background check, they are good to go.</p>\n<h4>On-demand delivery companies need modern card issuing to:</h4>\n<p><strong>• Gain control over driver payments</strong></p>\n<p>Modern card issuing platforms not only make it possible for on-demand delivery companies to get physical and virtual\ncards in the hands of new drivers quickly, but they also add security layers. This additional security is even more\nimportant today given the rising volume of <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/media/2020/200320.aspx\">fraud</a>.</p>\n<p>In an on-demand delivery case, companies can issue cards for their couriers with predefined spending controls — for\nexample, restaurant ID and the exact total amount of purchase — to avoid card misuse at other restaurants or fraudulent\nadd-ons. Restricting when, where, and how these cards are used provides additional protection and ensures cards are used\nfor their intended purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>• Generate new revenue streams</strong></p>\n<p>Business expenses can be turned into a revenue generator. By issuing cards through modern card issuing platforms,\ncompanies will be able to generate new revenue streams by earning transaction fees on every card payment made by\ndelivery drivers.</p>\n<p><strong>• Obtain end-to-end insights</strong></p>\n<p>Through modern card issuance, delivery companies can gain end-to-end, real-time insights over every transaction to help\nthem and their restaurants learn more about delivery preferences – to better serve end customers' needs and wants.</p>\n<p><em>Figure out how SimpliFi's <a href=\"/solutions\">corporate spend card</a> programs can help you streamline driver-related payments\nand power your on-demand food delivery business.</em></p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

As gig economy companies look to retain their workforce relationships, addressing payment needs to empower a\nfinancially healthy gig workforce will help them gain a competitive edge.</p>\n<p>To secure the services and skills of the most sought-after gig economy workers, key payment facilitation issues need to\nbe addressed.</p>\n<h4>Gig Payment Challenges and Inefficiencies</h4>\n<p><strong>Gig workers experience unreliable demand fluctuations for their work</strong>, making income volatility a major challenge for\nthis group of people.</p>\n<p>For instance, during the Covid-19 lockdown, consumer demand for home delivery skyrocketed while their interest in\nride-sharing dropped due to health concerns. These inconsistencies can lead to substantial swings in income from one\nmonth to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Another key challenge with gig worker payments is the likelihood of receiving untimely and delayed payments</strong>. Traditional\nbank and wallet-based transfers that rely on batch processing and third parties increase the time between when a gig\nworker delivers work and when they receive payments. This makes it difficult for gig workers to access their earned\nwages instantaneously and fulfill their recurring financial obligations in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.thinkforwardinitiative.com/research/living-gig-to-gig-and-paycheque-to-paycheque-how-income-volatility-affects-financial-decisions\">Think Forward Initiative report</a>\nshows that workers who experience such challenges encounter more financial stress, lower savings, and difficulty making\nends meet.</p>\n<p>Organizations and gig platforms need to replace their complex, slow, and costly payment processing methods with\nreal-time payments to ensure immediate payment transfers and settlements.</p>\n<p>Gig workers are increasingly craving efficient and flexible payment experiences. In fact,\n<a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/if-every-day-was-payday-making-the-gig-economy-work-smarter/\">85%</a>\nof the gig workforce is willing to work more often if they could get paid faster.</p>\n<h4>Modern card issuance: Fostering Lasting Relationships with Gig Workers</h4>\n<p><strong>By directly addressing long-standing gig payment inefficiencies, payment solutions capitalizing on real-time\ncapabilities can help businesses a) elevate gig worker experience b) foster loyalty, and c) reduce costs of attracting\nand retaining gig talent.</strong></p>\n<p>So, how can your business reap these benefits? Through <strong>Modern card issuance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Modern card issuance is a secure and flexible way of issuing cards by creating customizable, flexible card programs\nthrough open APIs. Your organization can issue and fund cards instantly to provide workers with immediate access to\ntheir earned wages.</p>\n<p>Receiving payments quickly and seamlessly as soon as the job is completed is a great motivator for gig workers.\nReal-time, on-demand gig worker payouts can help build loyalty and engagement. According to a survey conducted by Visa\nand Directions Research, <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/global/run-your-business/documents/visa-direct-gig-research-infographic.pdf\">over half</a>\nof the surveyed gig workers prefer real-time payouts.</p>\n<p>What's more, using modern card issuance solutions, organizations can issue their own branded cards, which can further\ndeepen the relationship with gig workers on your team. In addition, through programmable features, companies can not\nonly automate payouts but also customize them such as the timing of the payout and % of the amount paid by linking them\nto the rating of the gig worker or his tenure.</p>\n<p>Embracing payment platforms that address gig workers' pain points through real-time money movement and a range of\nflexible payment options allows your businesses to strengthen vital working relationships with gig workers and also\nattract top talent.</p>\n<p>Give workers the financial peace of mind they want with the speed and flexibility of Modern Card Issuing Platforms.\nExplore SimpliFi's <a href=\"/solutions\">corporate payout solutions</a> to strengthen and streamline gig worker relationships.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/013-main.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>RegTech is more than just a buzzword in the global financial and compliance community. So what is RegTech and why is it\ngaining prominence?.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, RegTech is the fusion of the words Regulatory and Technology.</p>\n<p>RegTech is the technology that applies innovative capabilities and techniques to help financial institutions improve\nregulatory governance, reporting, compliance, and risk management. It is making the shift from just a fancy buzzword to\nbecoming a vital piece of the regulatory and compliance landscape.</p>\n<h4>History of RegTech</h4>\n<p>The history of RegTech can be categorized into three phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RegTech 1.0 (1990):</strong> This comprised quantitative risk management practices that we are familiar with today.</li>\n<li><strong>RegTech 2.0 (2000):</strong> Tools helping companies comply with regulations and improving supervision activities focusing on KYC.</li>\n<li>and the industry is now on the verge of <strong>RegTech 3.0:</strong> Shifting from ‘know your customer' to ‘know your data' –\ninterpreting compliance-related data and improving predictability through AI to drive efficiencies and reduce risk.\nRegTech is not new. However, like any other application of technology, it is developing rapidly due to the decreasing\ncosts of emerging tech, expansion of data, and a staggering increase in computing power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, the 2008 financial crisis represented a turning point in the development of RegTech. The consequent regulatory\nchanges and technological developments have fundamentally changed the nature of financial markets, services, and\ninstitutions.</p>\n<p>Post-crisis fines have exceeded <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/misbehaving-banks-have-now-paid-204b-in-fines.html\">US$200 billion</a>,\nand the ongoing cost of regulation and compliance has become a primary  concern industry-wide – facilitating the\nemergence of RegTech.</p>\n<p>RegTech is disrupting the financial sector and in order to illustrate how, we need to deep dive into the main challenges\nand pressure points faced by financial institutions that RegTech is meant to address:</p>\n<p>Challenges faced by financial institutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing high costs of compliance</li>\n<li>Introduction of additional financial regulations</li>\n<li>Rising penalty fees on non-compliance with regulations</li>\n<li>Legacy systems constraints due to insufficient automation &amp; digitization to meet the pace of regulatory changes</li>\n<li>Incompatible systems resulting in insufficient integrations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current legacy solutions adopted by financial firms are ill-fitted to overcome such challenges and meet the stringent\nrequirements continuously passed down by regulators.</p>\n<p>And so, the demand for regulatory frameworks that give rise to more granularity and transparency has skyrocketed in the\nlast few years.</p>\n<p>The global RegTech market size is expected to grow from $7.6 billion in 2021 to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-regtech-market-size-expected-093000788.html\">$19.5 billion</a>\nby 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.8%.</p>\n<h4>Financial Institutions combating compliance and regulatory challenges with RegTech</h4>\n<p>The time is NOW for the financial sector to explore the capabilities of AI-powered risk and compliance management\nsystems.</p>\n<p>Capitalizing on big data and machine learning technologies, RegTech solutions analyze huge volumes of data from numerous\nsources at high speeds. This slashes the time needed to carry out highly complex analyses and checks, catalyzing\nimproved productivity and efficiency gains.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/industries/financial-services/fintech/fintech-insights/regtech-a-new-disruption-in-the-financial-services-space.html\">10–15%</a>\nof the workforce in financial institutions is dedicated to regulatory compliance matters. RegTech solutions can automate\nand streamline sophisticated tasks such as customer onboarding processes, enabling financial firms to potentially reduce\nthe time and compliance costs associated with such tasks by <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-companies-compliance.html\">30-50%</a>,\naccording to Deloitte.</p>\n<p>RegTech systems are paving the way for financial institutions to scale and adapt to the modern threat and regulatory\nlandscapes through <strong>a)</strong> Identifying suspicious activity more easily and <strong>b)</strong> accelerating risk detection and\nremediation of complex cases.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

The main\ncontributor to this upsurging growth, as the research suggests, is <strong>cross-border e-commerce</strong> with a total value\nexpected to reach over <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/20/1904132/0/en/Global-Cross-Border-B2C-E-Commerce-Market-Will-Reach-Over-USD-4-856-1-Billion-By-2027-Zion-Market-Research.html\">$4 trillion</a>\nby 2027.</p>\n<p>Although cross-border payments sit at the heart of international trade and economic activity, it acts as one of the key\nroadblocks to global e-commerce business growth and success.</p>\n<p>While the demand for cross-border commerce thrives, managing cross-border payments is still a challenge for most\norganizations. Cross-border payment affairs can especially impede small merchants from expanding their businesses\noverseas.</p>\n<p>First, let's define cross-border payments.</p>\n<p>Cross-border payments are broadly defined as fund transfers for which the sender and the recipient are located in\ndifferent countries/jurisdictions. These transactions can be made between individuals, companies, banks, or\ninstitutions.</p>\n<p>Banks and other financial institutions have taken many initiatives to help bridge the gap and simplify the process.\nHowever, traditional cross-border payment systems still have major pain points.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Fintechs are transforming the current scene; re-inventing cross-border payments, by enabling faster,\neasier, and more transparent international transactions.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will deep dive into cross-border payment challenges, and how fintech APIs can help merchants combat\nthese challenges and seize the trillion-dollar opportunity.</p>\n<h4>Cross-border Payments Challenges</h4>\n<p><strong>1. Slow transactions</strong></p>\n<p>Traditionally, cross-border transactions take between two to five days to process, and even longer for some\nless-developed markets. This counts as a very slow turnaround time compared to instant domestic payments\ntransactions. That's because numerous entities and intermediaries are involved with every single transaction, which\nresults in a series of steps often delaying the transfer of payments.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, organizations and merchants of all shapes and sizes want better visibility over financial transactions and\nmovement across their business, and cross-border transactions have been far from transparent.</p>\n<p>A SWIFT and EuroFinance survey found that <a href=\"https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/64-corporate-treasurers-ask-real-time-payments-tracking\">64% of corporations want real-time payment tracking capabilities</a>,\nwhile <a href=\"https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/64-corporate-treasurers-ask-real-time-payments-tracking\">47% want better visibility</a>\ninto the costs and deductions involved.</p>\n<p>A single cross-border transaction can go through multiple different intermediaries. As payments move across\ninternational waters, fees accumulate passing by every intermediary along the way – with no reliable way of calculating\nfor that near future hidden cost.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Security</strong></p>\n<p>There is no single global regulatory body controlling cross-border transactions. Every country abides by its own set\nof regulations. Therefore, the cross-border payment system is at risk of being hacked whenever money enters a country\nwith less-rigid security policies.</p>\n<p>In the past, cross-border payment systems have suffered from high-level security breaches, like Bangladesh central\nbank's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery\">$81 million heist</a> in 2016. Security hackers used a\nFederal Reserve Bank account in New York belonging to Bangladesh Bank to illegally transfer $1 Billion and successfully\nmanaged to steal $81 million.</p>\n<p><strong>4. High costs</strong></p>\n<p>Sending money from one country to another through banks has always been notoriously expensive. Money is channeled\nthrough several intermediaries, each of which charges a fee for its service – regulatory, SWIFT, chargeback, and FX\nfees.</p>\n<h4>Harnessing the Trillion-Dollar opportunity using Fintech APIs</h4>\n<p><strong>This trillion-dollar cross-border e-commerce market is being shaken up by the rush of new entrants that promise to solve\nlong-standing pitfalls.</strong></p>\n<p>Overcoming cross-border payment challenges and barriers is becoming easier every day, but exploring reliable\ncross-border payment solutions is paramount to navigating the world of global commerce.</p>\n<p>As the pandemic pushed the fast-forward button on innovation in payment systems, Fintech APIs are reducing the friction\nand increasing the efficiency needed to make cross-border transactions feel more like domestic payments. That means\ncutting down on transaction processing time, removing hidden costs, and mimicking the domestic payments experience.</p>\n<p>Fintech APIs, through single API integrations, are setting a new standard of trading without borders, enabling faster &amp;\nsimpler transactions and a more transparent system of cross-border payments.</p>\n<p>With real-time payment tracking and instant payment processing capabilities, Fintech APIs are making international\npayments more accessible to small businesses and merchants.</p>\n<p><em>Planning on globally scaling your business?

As a\nresult, popularity for BNPL boomed and merchants and retailers are looking to adopt BNPL offers across multiple business\nlines.

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/017-main.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Businesses around the world rely on one of the three following methods to pay their workers and vendors: <strong>writing\nchecks, sending electronic payments, and presenting payment cards</strong>. Until today.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, a growing number of digitally-driven companies have discovered a new, better way to make\npayments: Virtual cards.</p>\n<p><em>What are virtual cards?</em></p>\n<p>A virtual card works just like a physical card. It has all the same credentials as a physical payment card, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cardholder Name</li>\n<li>16-digit card number</li>\n<li>CVC</li>\n<li>Expiry Date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Virtual cards empower organizations with visibility and control overspending in the new and modern era of remote\nworking. A virtual card can be generated instantaneously either for an online one-time transaction or multiple recurring\nones. It can also be created for specific use cases such as payment for a certain subscription on a recurring basis or\nfor travel for a specific trip.</p>\n<p>The controls that an organization can put on the cards can help it preserve its budget, minimize fraud risks, and\nincrease control over expenses. This is driving more businesses than ever to opt for virtual cards to manage their\nfinances.</p>\n<h4>Food for thought: Imagine you run a food delivery business</h4>\n<p><em>By using one-time virtual cards, you can program cards for the thousands of delivery drivers in your network with the\nexact amount of each food pick-up, the location and the time. This allows for a high level of control and helps you\nmonitor transactions more easily.</em></p>\n<p>Your business can benefit from virtual cards too</p>\n<p><strong>1. Stay on top of vendor payments</strong></p>\n<p>Create virtual cards with custom spending limits for each vendor or subscription service your business uses to avoid\novercharges and/or manage recurring fees.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Manage card &amp; spend controls easily</strong></p>\n<p>You can easily freeze virtual cards, as well as set spending limits, or program them for one-time usage. This way you\ncan control your budgets and limit how much your employees can spend. Limits can be mapped by job level, function,\ngeography etc. thereby allowing a high degree of flexibility and control on the spend depending on the user.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Reduce Fraud Risks</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple employees and vendors share corporate cards, organizations are exposed to higher fraud risks. Using\nvirtual cards can make electronic payments safer and more secure.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Make online purchasing easier for high performing teams</strong></p>\n<p>In a new world where teams need to be agile, facilitating quick and efficient purchases of products and services is\nnecessary. Virtual cards can be instantly issued and with automatic set budgets.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Improve spending visibility and automation</strong></p>\n<p>Virtual cards provide rich transaction data. Every expense charged on the card, receipt uploaded or any detail\nentered can be shared with finance teams to easily track spending in real-time. This provides real-time visibility\ninto spending, enabling data-driven decisions that can streamline and automate different stages of the payment\nprocess.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/018-main.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>New fintechs are being born every day. But In a space that is getting crowded with dozens of startups entering the\nmarket and billion-dollar giants running the show, it can be challenging to get your piece of the pie.</p>\n<p>Before going any further with your Fintech idea, here are a few things you need to consider first.</p>\n<h4>Quick Notes on Building Your Own Fintech Product – A Recipe For Success</h4>\n<p>Entering the financial services industry is no walk in the park. Most fintech startups around the world are still\nstruggling to achieve profitability.</p>\n<p>According\nto <a href=\"https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/uk/pdf/2020/07/fintech-pulse-report-2020.pdf\">Google Cloud's fintech Focus Report</a>,\nbased on a survey sample size of 100 fintech startups, only 6% are breaking-even and 84% of the continuing businesses\nreported increasing losses in their last financial year.</p>\n<p>In order to navigate through the fintech ecosystem smoothly and build resilient solutions at scale, here are 3 crucial\nthemes you need to explore first.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Regulations</strong></p>\n<p>The increasing use of new technologies, often untested, in the financial services space introduces new risks and\nregulators and supervisors have been taking specific actions in response to these risks. This has included the\ndevelopment of international standards, revamping of domestic regulations and rules, and shifts in supervisory\npriorities.</p>\n<p>Firms entering the fintech space need to account for the ever-changing nature of regulation and supervision into their\nstrategies, business planning, governance, and risk management.</p>\n<p>In order to successfully break into the fintech industry, you need to be well-acquainted with all local and cross-border\nregulations of where you plan to do business.</p>\n<p>Different countries have different fintech regulatory requirements. To set up a fintech business, some countries require\norganizations to apply for specific licenses, while others have more general licensing requirements. The UAE &amp; Mexico\nare examples of countries where fintech organizations must apply\nfor <a href=\"https://www.cgap.org/blog/mexicos-fintech-law-leading-new-trend-fintech-regulation\">specific fintech licenses</a>\nto meet regulatory compliance requirements. On the other hand, in the UK there is no legislation that is aimed\nspecifically at the fintech sector. Fintech businesses will be most likely regulated by the respective industry in which\nthe organization operates.</p>\n<p>Designed to capture and monitor payment transaction details in real-time, RegTech can help you automate mundane\ncompliance tasks and reduce operational risk associated with meeting compliance obligations. Using Regtech tools you can\nfully or partially automate regulatory compliance-related processes.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Funding</strong></p>\n<p>There are substantial investment opportunities for fintech startups today.</p>\n<p>In 2021, fintech companies\nattracted <a href=\"http://localhost:3180/building-a-succesful-fintech-solution/#:~:text=%2491.5%20billion%20in%20global%20funding\">$91.5 billion in global funding</a> –\nalmost twice as much of funding raised in 2020.</p>\n<p>While in the Middle East, the value of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1181233/middle-east-fintech-venture-capital-investment-value/\">venture capital investments</a>\nin fintech is expected to increase to approximately $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to $78 million in 2017.</p>\n<p>But what are investors really looking for in their next fintech investment?</p>\n<p>Here are some of the main things investors look for when evaluating a fintech project or startup:</p>\n<p><strong>a. Products solving clear problems or customer pain points</strong></p>\n<p>They say &#8220;necessity is the mother of invention&#8221;</p>\n<p>It's all about finding new approaches to solving a problem – improving a current legacy system, or introducing a whole\nnew product or service that makes our lives easier.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://monese.com/gb/en\">Monese</a>, the first mobile current account in the UK, was built to serve migrants\nwho couldn't open bank\naccounts because they didn't have physical home addresses.</p>\n<p>Dubbed as the peace-of-mind money app, Monese is a digital banking alternative that allows anyone to open multi-currency\naccounts via a mobile application.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, investors pay attention to fintech ideas that go beyond short-term solutions that address underlying\nproblems and meet the needs of our changing lifestyles.</p>\n<p><strong>b. Powerful Teams</strong></p>\n<p>A great fintech idea is just as important as the team bringing that idea to life. The ability to access top talent is a\nkey growth driver in moving organizations forward. One of the key challenges found when building powerful fintech teams\nis striking a balance between technical and business needs. Hiring, training, and retaining capable business teams is\ncrucial to be able to leverage the success of technical know-how and resources. Showing investors that you have built\nsolid systems that can strike that balance can put you in a more favorable position.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Solution Scalability</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating the challenges of scaling and growth is a challenge for all startups. To win the hearts of investors you must\ndemonstrate how you can scale your business – platform, teams, operations – to expand from a single segment, use case\nand market to a multi-X. As a fintech startup, you need to understand that, when scaling, you can't do everything\nyourself. Knowing how to scale various facets of the business, including being able to partner to access the right\nassets and capabilities to scale rapidly is important. Make sure you have a vision to share with investors regarding how\nyou will cross that bridge when you come to it.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Integration</strong></p>\n<p>Traditionally, connecting platforms with banking and payment infrastructure required development teams to build\nintegrations for each financial institution involved – this is very costly, complex, and time-consuming.</p>\n<p>Today, there is no need to reinvent the wheel – you can save valuable time to market and mitigate costs by using fintech\nAPIs as building blocks to avoid recreating functionality that already exists.</p>\n<p>APIs are driving an explosion of new business models. Organizations looking to enter the fintech space need to learn to\nleverage APIs to power innovation and new product/feature development.</p>\n<p>Aligning business objectives with the right technology is imperative to any fintech product's sustainable growth. If\nyour value proposition is the brain of the operation, APIs are the heart. Figure out early on what you will develop\nin-house and whose technology you can utilize to help you grow.</p>\n<h4>Explore SimpliFi Fintech APIs</h4>\n<p><a href=\"/\">SimpliFi</a> is a Card-as-service (CaaS) platform on a mission to democratize payments in the MENA region and\nPakistan.

        "content": "<p><img src=\"/images/blogs/019-main.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The MENA region has seen a surge of fintech startups within the past few\nyears. <a href=\"https://www.bwmonline.com/2021/07/29/mena-fintech-outlook-2021-pandemic-ushers-in-new-growth/\">In November 2020</a>,\nthe region had over 400 fintech ventures.</p>\n<p>Fintech is disrupting many business verticals and entrepreneurs around the world are constantly introducing new ways to\nbank through their Fintech startups.</p>\n<p>But it is not all sunshine and rainbows. Entrepreneurs face several challenges and roadblocks when launching Fintech\nstartups.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will tackle the three most common technical challenges faced by Fintech startups.</p>\n<h4>What are the most common Fintech challenges faced by startups?</h4>\n<p><strong>1. Cyber Security Risks</strong></p>\n<p><em>With great power comes great responsibility.</em></p>\n<p>Access to sensitive financial and personal information makes fighting off cybercriminals a daily responsibility for\nFintechs.</p>\n<p>According to Verizon’s Data Breach\nReport, <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf\">9 in 10</a>\ndata breaches are financially driven. Therefore, robust security and privacy protocols are paramount for Fintech\nproducts. Whether it’s biometric, two-factor, or risk-based authentication, Fintechs will need to invest in the best\ntech-driven security measures to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Complex Regulations &amp; Compliance</strong></p>\n<p>As pressure increases on Fintech startups to address existing or potential regulatory hurdles, this inevitably leads to\nthe slowdown of their speed to market.</p>\n<p>Therefore, as a startup, it is crucial to be aware of the regulatory framework of the financial system in your region:\n<em>Are there existing regulations governing your products/services? Do you comply with them? What licenses are required?\nShould you partner with another company that has already acquired the license?</em></p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"/what-is-regtech\">Regtech</a> comes into play. Regtech is an emerging industry enabling regulatory\ncompliance using technology to ease the burden on companies. Relying on the latest fintech technologies to address\nregulatory schemes and compliance, Regtech companies act as a bridge between regulators and financial institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Human-Tech Balance</strong></p>\n<p>As the use of AI and machine learning continues to increase, services are becoming more human-less.</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority of customers in the MENA region prefer to interact with a human when handling their finances.\nThis can leave many Fintech startups struggling to persuade customers in the region to abandon their traditional banks.</p>\n<p>For Fintechs to overcome this &#8220;confidence gap&#8221;, a customer-centric financial model is paramount to be able to achieve\nthe human-tech balance. This can happen through keeping customers’ needs and experience at the heart of every new\ntechnology adopted.</p>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"

Where should I offer payments and other financial services today? Where do I plan to\nexpand in the future?</li>\n<li>Will building my own payments solution give me better control over user experience, drive loyalty or reduce\noperational costs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read our blog post on <a href=\"/embedded-finance-strategy\">Designing an embedded finance strategy that works for your business</a>\nand explore various opportunities to get into the embedded finance game.</p>\n<p>1.Build</p>\n<p>If you prioritize control and customization or need to address specific business/market needs, building your own\nsolution may be the best option for your business.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of building an embedded finance solution in-house</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control &amp; Customization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have 100% control over the development process. Building your own embedded finance features or solutions means that\nyou are in charge of defining the scope of your innovation initiatives. With that control comes flexibility and freedom\nto add the desired functionality and features to support your unique business needs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long Term Incremental Cost at Scale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features are developed in the order desired, with the flexibility to potentially change that order as business goals\nshift. You can build your own solution with the functions that you need only, without the bloat of unwanted features.\nThis way, you can eliminate the costs of unnecessary features, recurring subscription fees, and other hidden costs that\nadd up in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons of building an embedded finance solution in-house</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regulations &amp; Compliance Requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether it's complying with never-ending financial regulations or undergoing multiple security and risk assessments,\nbuilding an embedded finance solution from scratch can be extremely bureaucratic and time-consuming. This also exposes\nyou to unnecessary risk in an industry that you are not familiar with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time to Market and Upfront Investment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Acquiring qualified teams and managing product development cycles can be very expensive. Building software from scratch\nrequires significant investment in financial capital and time. In addition, at times the infrastructure setup itself can\nbe costly and require significant scale to justify the investment. It also takes your focus away from your core business\nwhich can have various consequences short and long term.</p>\n<p>2.Buy</p>\n<p>If your challenges are well-defined, are commonly found in your industry, and can mostly be addressed by existing\nsolutions, then you should consider buying or white-labeling a ready-made solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of buying an embedded finance solution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opting for a ready-made product or solution can be less of a financial burden than building your own from scratch. This\nwill allow you to save on the increasing costs of ongoing development, maintenance, and updates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time-to-Market</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ready-made solutions can get up and running faster. Regulatory compliance, development, and testing are taken care of\nallowing you to launch products and services at a much faster time to market. This allows you to test out your concepts\nin a quick manner and iterate rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons of buying an embedded finance solution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recurring Costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For smaller businesses and organizations, off-the-shelf solutions often come with hefty monthly subscription fees.\nSubscriptions tend to be priced per user and/or usage and therefore as businesses scale, consistent recurring fees can\nbecome a major financial burden.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No matter how many features an off-the-shelf solution provides, they will not fully suit your specific requirements.\nPoor product-market fit and the need to further implement workarounds or buy additional software can add up very\nquickly.</p>\n<h4>Tip by SimpliFi</h4>\n<p>There are a lot of factors to consider such as <strong>control</strong>, <strong>monetary costs</strong>, <strong>time to market</strong>, <strong>customization</strong>,\nand <strong>implementation</strong> to be able to choose the right path for your organization. <strong>So, build or buy?</strong> There is no one\nsize fits all answer to the question.

Scale your products and services faster with minimal investment\nacross different markets without the need to become a payments expert.</li>\n<li><strong>Elevated Customer Experiences</strong>\nCustomers no longer have to deal with multiple entities to fulfill their financial needs. By embedding financial\nservices in your user journeys and features, you can provide customers with simple and seamless purchasing journeys\nand financial services that are highly contextualized and relevant.</li>\n<li><strong>Brand Equity</strong>\nOffering highly relevant personal financial services and access to customer data can deepen your relationship with\nyour stakeholders and in turn boost brand equity. Businesses can use this data to retain customers and partners,\nbuild trust and loyalty and essentially increase customer and partner lifetime value.</li>\n<li><strong>Decreased Operational Spend</strong>\nManaging your own financial services means massive savings over time. Save money on direct recurring expenses, such\nas processing fees and foreign exchange commissions as well as indirect operational expenses from managing large\nfinancial operations teams to handle settlement and reconciliation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Want to find out more? <a href=\"/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> with our team today!</em></p>"
